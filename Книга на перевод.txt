Preface




Life in the twenty-first century has become more complex and challenging. More and
more people worldwide are suffering from mental health issues that also lead to phys-
ical health challenges. Relationship breakdowns are causing increased family and
social problems. Workplace stress and tension are causing burnout and discontent-
ment. A lack of social-awareness is weakening government commitment to solving
wicked problems like homelessness and the widening gap between the haves and the
have-nots. It is time for us all to become more self-aware, other-aware and society-
and community-aware to help solve these problems.
   This book aims to heighten readers’ awareness of the importance of Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and how it impacts our lives. It aims to inspire parents, teachers
and school leaders to learn more about EI as a process of self-improvement and a
set of relational skills, and to help our students to develop it from the early stages of
their lives. It presents theories and models of EI along with research-based evidence
about how our emotions affect our cognition, behaviour and relationships.
   Its logical structure guides readers from knowledge to practice by presenting an
overview of each topic followed by in-depth applications and research data from
scholarly writings. It can therefore facilitate advancements in EI practice in areas
such as education, family relational understanding, organisational behaviour and
management, and public health and harmony.
   The book covers a wide range of topics on EI, giving in-depth explorations of
each topic to suit a wide readership, from advanced students and parents to educa-
tional professionals, workplace leaders and top-level executives. Its information-
dense content covers major areas of interest spanning school education, workplace
development and family life.
   The author is able to capture readers’ attention with gripping messages in every
chapter to show them the benefits of EI in different situations. The writing is easy
to read but the content is deep. The chapters are clearly structured and numbered
with sub-topics to clarify, expand or illuminate the main idea, completing the big
picture with evidence-based literature citations. The anecdotal examples bring to life
the theoretical arguments and are easily relatable to anyone in any relationships.

   The four parts of the book are aimed at different groups, and each chapter can
be read as a stand-alone essay on a specific topic. Key points are highlighted in
bullets to present essential information quickly and effectively. The tone of the book
is positive and inspirational, with enticing cues to capture the reader’s curiosity to
read on. The book has received positive reviews from leadership coaches, workplace
EI counsellors and school principals who all look forward to buying a copy for their
organisation.
Part I: Understanding Emotional Intelligence and Our Emotions explains the
importance of Emotional Intelligence to every aspect of our lives. It presents models
and theories of EI, and explains how our emotions control our minds, bodies and
spirits. Drawing on references from scientific research literature, it describes how,
if we do not control our emotions, they will control us, leading to poor choices and
negative consequences. It also describes how our hormones affect our emotions and
our emotions affect our cognitive ability, behaviour and health. Finally, it presents
some strategies to increase our EI.
Part II: Emotional Intelligence and Relationships gives insights into the signifi-
cant role that emotions play in our relationships with others. It discusses the emotions
involved in family relationships, marital relationships, parent-child relationships,
sibling relationships and peer relationships, and sheds light on how awareness of
our emotions can help us prevent and resolve relationship conflicts, build positive
relationships and lead a healthy and happy life.
Part III: Emotional Intelligence and Workplace Success takes the reader from
family to the workplace and highlights the importance of becoming more aware
of our emotions and how we relate to others at work. By developing a more vivid
understanding of ourselves and our emotions at work, we can both relate to others
better and work more effectively. Part III also discusses the importance of leadership,
and how leadership EI can improve organisational effectiveness and create a posi-
tive work environment. Some practical guides and suggestions for how to increase
workplace EI are also provided.
Part IV: Emotional Intelligence and School Education emphasises the impor-
tance of helping students to develop essential EI in order to face the increasingly
complex and challenging world they live in. It discusses the relationship between
emotions and mental health, and how students, parents and teachers can work collabo-
ratively to help young people avoid or overcome mental health issues. It also presents
studies of teachers’ emotions and how they can affect students, stressing the impor-
tance of preparing teachers to be more emotionally intelligent not only for their own
self-improvement, but also to aid them in building relationships with students, and
gaining a repertoire of skills and knowledge to teach EI at school level. A range of
practical guides, strategies and resource links is included.

Understanding Emotional Intelligence




1.1 Introduction

Our emotions play a vital role in our general wellbeing and mental health. They
affect how we manage relationships and connect with others. Having the knowledge
and skills to increase our emotional intelligence (EI) therefore enhances our ability
to better understand ourselves and other people around us. This chapter outlines
the current understanding of EI, presents the major models and theories explaining
the different aspects of EI, explains how Emotional Quotient (EQ) is measured and
highlights the benefits of having high EI.



1.2 What Is EI?

In his award-winning book Thinking, fast and slow (2011), Nobel prize winner Daniel
Kahneman talks about the two systems in our brain that are persistently fighting for
control of our behaviour and actions—a battle that sometimes leads to errors in judge-
ment and poor decisions. System 1 (Thinking Fast) is governed by the unconscious
mind and can lead us to make snap judgements and bad decisions based on biased
perceptions. System 2 (Thinking Slow) is analytical, problem-solving and evalua-
tive. Without training to develop our EI (Thinking Slow), many of us act in haste,
propelled by our emotions (Thinking Fast). This can lead us to lay blame on others,
deny responsibility for our actions and avoid thinking about how others feel.
    In a similar vein, American psychologist Daniel Goleman (1995) suggests that
we each have both a thinking mind and a feeling mind. Goleman states that our
behaviours are usually governed by our feeling minds, which drive us to react before
our thinking minds have had time to process information and determine the best action
to take. This strong impulse that urges us to take immediate action is neurologically
designed to propel us into action as part of a ‘flight or fight’ response. This natural

survival mechanism served to save our cave-dwelling ancestors from being gobbled
up by man-eating beasts.
   Goleman (1995) described four domains of EI:
1.   Self-awareness.
2.   Other-awareness (Social awareness).
3.   Self-management
4.   Relationship Management.
Inspired by Goleman’s book Emotional intelligence (1995), which became a best-
seller worldwide, readers became fascinated with emotions and how they affect us.
This ignited a keen interest in people from all walks of life wanting to learn more
about how to manage their emotions. Suddenly, EI became a popular interest amongst
researchers and psychologists.



1.2.1 Self-Awareness

Goleman (1995) argues that to be emotionally intelligent, we need to develop self-
awareness and be able to self-assess how we respond to different situations. Self-
awareness is the ability to recognise and understand how our actions are affected by
our emotions and how we tend to react to certain situations. It increases our ability to
distinguish between positive and negative emotions and to identify triggers that drive
us to react in inappropriate ways. There is an old Chinese saying, ‘Knowing yourself
is the beginning of all wisdom’, and it is true that when we become more self-aware of
our emotions, we gain clarity about our beliefs and principles, values and motivations,
thinking patterns and what we want out of life. When we are more self-aware, we
can also protect ourselves from slipping into negative thought patterns, because that
self-awareness enables us to distinguish between helpful and harmful behaviours and
actions. It also helps us to understand the different defence mechanisms that affect
how we relate to others, and how other people see us.



1.2.2 Managing Emotions

Whether we know it or not, we all manage our emotions in both helpful and harmful
ways. Having the skills and knowledge needed for emotion management increases our
control over impulsive feelings and behaviours. This, in turn, prompts us to follow
through on our commitments and be more adaptable to changing circumstances.
In other words, self-control (self-regulation) is an emotional management skill. It
includes flexibility and the ability to adapt to change, increases our trustworthiness
and conscientiousness, and trains our minds to tame our fight-or-flight responses
when confronted with provoking stimuli and take time to think.
1.2 What is EI?                                                                       3

   Since the turn of the century, studies on self-regulation as part of emotional
management have sprung up like mushrooms. Some of the more popular strategies
include:
• Attentional control: a strategy that aims to divert our attention away from negative
  emotions and toward more pleasant ones, or to help us think about how we could
  do better in dealing with confronting situations in future.
• Reappraisal: a strategy that uses thought evaluation to look for better ways to deal
  with pain and unpleasant emotions, and replaces negative thoughts with positive
  ones.
• Self-soothing strategies: a strategy that uses self-soothing methods such as medi-
  tation, music therapy, breathing exercises and self-pampering (e.g., taking a hot
  bath or having a massage) to deal with anger or pain.
We can learn how to manage and regulate our emotions at any stage of our lives. When
we are able to manage our emotions, we tend to become more optimistic, motivated
and able to achieve more with increased self-confidence. We become victors and not
victims. More about emotional regulations will be discussed throughout the different
chapters in this book.



1.2.3 Empathy and Social Awareness

Psychologists tell us that a child begins to develop self-other recognition in the first
year of life, and that this social-cognitive competence shows a sharp increase at the
age of two (Asendorpf & Baudonnitre, 1993). Self-other recognition begins when
children recognise themselves in the mirror, and progresses to them learning to gain
attention from others and communicate their wants and needs by different means,
such as crying, cooing and reacting differently to faces familiar or new to them. Some
also react with empathetic behaviour to people who are in distress. For example, if
a parent pretends to cry or show hurt, the baby will respond with soothing actions
such as touching their face or the hurt part. However, as we get older we become
less sensitive to others and therefore not as empathetic as we were when we were
innocent little infants. Sometimes, it takes will and skill for us to develop sufficient
empathy to accurately understand the emotions of other people.
   Goleman (1995) points out that people who are high in EI are sensitive and
responsive to other people’s social signals, recognising their facial expressions,
body language and posture, their tone of voice and their eye movements, speech
characteristics and breathing characteristics.
   Other-awareness is our ability to perceive how our behaviour, attitudes, and
language impact others. When we are other-aware, we can easily understand why
certain emotions may have arisen in certain contexts, and will also have the skills to
de-escalate such emotions and help others keep calm.
   Literature on EI often lists empathy, respect, authenticity, acceptance and toler-
ance, and perspective-taking as important elements of other-awareness and EI. These
4                                                  1 Understanding Emotional Intelligence

capabilities are especially important for teachers and educators, leaders, members of
the health care professions and social workers. They are also skills that are learnable,
and could even be included in school curricula. Further discussion on how to develop
other-awareness is illustrated throughout different chapters in this book.



1.2.4 Relationships Skills

To develop a stronger sense of self-awareness, we need to look inward to understand
our emotions and what drives our behaviours and actions. However, both social
awareness and other-awareness also require the ability to look outward and learn
how to appropriately respond to other people’s emotions and behaviour. In fact, social
awareness is defined as the ability to take in the perspectives of others, especially
those from backgrounds and cultures different from our own.
    To become more socially aware, it is therefore essential for us to understand
others’ cultural values, traditions, communication styles and relational patterns. As
people high in EI tend to listen more and refrain from judging, and are more able
to identify their emotional biases and think before they speak, EI can help with this.
Part II of this book is devoted to understanding relationships and EI. Readers will
gain more understanding of this topic and be able to access resources to build their
relational EI.
    Because EI is easier to learn if we start early, in our infancy and school days, this
book aims to inspire parents, teachers and school leaders to pay attention to building
the EI of our children and future generations. To do this, however, they must first
develop a better understanding of their own EI and how to apply it.



1.3 IQ, EQ and EI

Renowned American public speaker Clarence Caldwell claims that “IQ shows what
you know, EQ shows who you are”. Numerous self-improvement articles throughout
the web also mention the notion that IQ + EQ = Success. But what exactly do these
terms mean?



1.3.1 What Is IQ?

IQ stands for intelligence quotient, which is a measure of intellectual abilities. The
first IQ test was introduced by French psychologist Alfred Binet in 1904; it is now
being replaced by a range of new tests which measure different aspects of intelligence
and cognitive skills. These tests can be helpful in determining interventions for
schoolchildren who show signs of learning difficulties. They are also frequently used
1.3 IQ, EQ and EI                                                                   5

for workplace recruitment and as entry criteria for college or university degrees, the
military and other professional preparation courses.
   Most IQ tests measure how people understand and apply information, mathe-
matical skills, logical reasoning, word and text comprehension, abstract and spatial
thinking, and the ability to filter irrelevant information. Most individuals score
between 80 and 110 on an IQ test.
   People with scores above 110 are considered highly intelligent, and those above
130 are ‘exceptionally smart’ or gifted. Scores below 70 are considered cause for
concern, and further testing may be required to determine test accuracy or whether
future intervention is needed to support learning at school.
   The most common IQ tests currently in use are the:
•   Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale.
•   Differential Ability Scales.
•   Peabody Individual Achievement Test.
•   Universal Nonverbal Intelligence.
•   Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.
•   Wechsler Individual Achievement Test.
•   Woodcock Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Disabilities.
According to the website Science Trends, the highest IQ score ever recorded belongs
to Ainan Celeste Cawley, a Singaporean prodigy born in 1999, who scored 263.
He passed his GCSE chemistry exam at the age of seven and studied chemistry at
Singapore Polytechnic at the age of eight. This site also notes that Stephen Hawkins
had an IQ score of 160, while Albert Einstein scored between 160–190. Both Bill
Gates and Steve Jobs are mentioned as having IQ scores of 160.



1.3.2 What Is EQ?

As previously mentioned, EQ stands for Emotional Quotient. In 1982, Israeli
psychologist Reuven Bar-On, one of the leading theorists of EI, developed the Bar-
On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i). It was designed to assess individuals’
emotional and social competencies, and therefore measures the ability
•   to be aware of one’s emotions, understand and express emotions,
•   to understand how others feel and how to interact with others,
•   to manage and control one’s emotions,
•   to manage change, adapt and solve intrapersonal and interpersonal problems,
•   to generate positive affect to enhance self-motivation. (Bar-On, 1997)
The test comprises 133 items—short questions designed to elicit self-reported
responses—grouped into 15 scales.. Some years later, Bar-On also developed a
multi-rater version of an EQ scale named the Bar-On EQ 360. This involves both
self-rating, and the rating of various groups of people in the workplace. Raw scores
6                                                 1 Understanding Emotional Intelligence

are computer-tabulated and converted to EQ scores. These measurement tools have
been translated into more than 30 languages and used in business and government
corporations around the world.



1.3.3 What Is EI?

Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a relatively new construct in psychology. It is generally
described as the ability to identify, understand and assess one’s emotions and those
of people one interacts with. In the current literature, EI and EQ are interchangeable
terms. Those described as having high EQ or EI are more likely to be able to identify,
evaluate, express, and control their own emotions, and use emotions to facilitate
thinking and relationship building. In the workplace, people with high EQ scores or
well-developed EI are likely to be able to establish amicable working relationships,
show leadership, and be motivated and competent in problem-solving and coping
with challenges.



1.4 Theories and Models of EI

Theories and models are developed through empirical studies to enable us to think
about, investigate and measure specific concepts or sets of concepts in order to enrich
our understanding of a certain topic. They allow us to apply them for use in personal
development or intervention in helping others. Theories on EI were first noted when
psychologists began to take an interest in emotions and how they affect behaviours
and actions in the 1920s, with Thorndike being the first to describe social intelligence
as a form of human intelligence (Thorndike & Stein, 1937). Thorndike (1937) defined
social intelligence as “the ability to understand and manage men, women, boys, and
girls to act wisely in human relationships” (p. 231). However, it was not until the
1980s that a burst of interest sparked research and theories on emotions and EI.
   The first publication bearing the term EI was written by American psychology
professors Peter Salovey and John Mayer in 1989, following a paper by Beasley
(1987) that defined EQ and another by Gardner (1983) arguing that humans
have multiple intelligences, including linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial,
bodily-kinaesthetic, musical, naturalist, intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences.
Gardner (1983) described intrapersonal intelligence as the ability to “deal with
oneself, the ability to symbolise complex and highly differentiated sets of feelings”
(p. 239) and interpersonal intelligence as “the intelligence in dealing with others
and to notice and make distinctions among other individuals and, in particular, among
their moods, temperaments, motivations and intensions” (p. 239). This resonates with
Goleman’s philosophy that “If you are tuned out of your own emotions, you will be
poor in reading them in other people” (Goleman, 1995).
1.4 Theories and Models of EI                                                          7

   In social sciences such as Education and Psychology, models are important
because they provide a framework to guide thinking and investigation. Of the many
models of EI that have been developed over the years in the social science literature,
there are three major models that are highly recognised and used as references and
for practice. They are:
• Bar-On’s EI competencies model.
• Mayer, Salovey and Caruso’s EI ability model.
• Goleman’s EI performance model.


1.4.1 Bar-On’s EI Competencies Model

Bar-On adopts a mixed approach that views EI as a balance of social skills, emotional
skills and the individual’s associated aptitudes for making smart decisions and taking
action. He describes 15 factors that are closely related to emotions, behaviour and
social competence (Bar-On, 2001). These factors are:
1.    Self-regard: the ability to look inward, and perceive and understand ourselves
      and our behaviours.
2.    Emotional self-awareness: the ability to be aware and identify our emotions.
3.    Assertiveness/ Emotional self-expression: the ability to express our feelings
      in a positive manner.
4.    Independence: the ability to be self-reliant and free of emotional dependency
      on others.
5.    Empathy: the ability to be aware of and understand how others feel.
6.    Social responsibility: the ability to identify with social groups, work in teams,
      cooperate with others and contribute to our community in a constructive way.
7.    Interpersonal relationships: the ability to form and maintain mutually
      satisfying relationships with others.
8.    Stress tolerance: the ability to manage our emotions in disputes and testing
      times.
9.    Impulse control: the ability to effectively control our emotions and resist the
      impulse to act when confronted with challenging situations.
10.   Reality testing: the ability to validate our feelings and access ‘reality’ against
      our biased perceptions and thoughts.
11.   Flexibility: the ability to adapt and adjust our feelings and actions, and behave
      calmly and rationally in atypical circumstances.
12.   Problem-solving: the ability to solve problems effectively and calmly.
13.   Self-actualisation: the ability to set personal goals and have the drive to achieve
      them.
14.   Optimism: the ability to maintain a hopeful and positive attitude to life,
      especially in the face of adversity.
15.   Happiness and wellbeing: the ability to feel comfortable and content with
      ourselves, with others and with life in general.
8                                                 1 Understanding Emotional Intelligence

The Bar-On competency model is built on the theory that emotional and social
competencies are skills that can be taught and learned. In some parts of the USA,
this model is used in the school curriculum and to help university students increase
their ability to recognise and manage emotions, relate to others, adapt to change, solve
personal and interpersonal problems and efficiently cope with the daily demands of
university life. It is also popular in business and the corporate world as a component
of staff development programs.



1.4.2 Mayer, Salovey and Caruso’s EI Ability Models

Mayer, Salovey and Caruso believe that EI is not innate, but an ability that can be
learned and applied to match emotions to tasks, people management and relation-
ship building (Mayer et al., 2004). They define EI as “the capacity to reason about
emotions, and of emotions, to enhance thinking … to accurately perceive emotions
and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote
emotional and intellectual growth” (p. 198).
   The Mayer, Salovey and Caruso EI Model includes four elements. These are:
1.   Perceiving emotions: the ability to decipher emotions in facial expressions,
     voices, and cultural artefacts, including the ability to process information from
     sensory cues to make sense of one’s own emotions and those of others.
2.   Using emotions: the ability to detect moods and to harness one’s own emotions
     to think and problem-solve.
3.   Understanding emotions: the ability to understand how emotions evolve over
     time, to appreciate complications in relationships and to understand emotions
     and language.
4.   Managing emotions: the ability to achieve goals by harnessing both positive
     and negative emotions, and the ability to regulate one’s own emotions and those
     of others.
These abilities are measured by the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence
Test (MSCEIT). There are two parts to the test: the Experiential Emotional Intel-
ligence Score and the Strategic Emotional Intelligence Score. The Experiential
section assesses the individual’s capacity to feel emotion and do so productively. It
involves perceiving emotions in facial expressions in pictures, facilitating thoughts
and showing understanding of how moods affect our reasoning. It also requires the
participant to compare different emotions to different sensations, such as temperature,
light and colour.
   The Strategic section involves higher levels of conscious emotion processing.
This part includes two sets of tasks: Understanding Emotion Changes tasks and
Emotional Management tasks.
   The Understanding Emotion Changes tasks measure the participant’s ability to
understanding emotions and how they can transition from one to another (e.g.,
how sadness can lead to depression). The Emotional Management tasks require
1.4 Theories and Models of EI                                                       9

the participant to rate the effectiveness of different actions for achieving goals and
attaining results, and to decide what actions to take to achieve outcomes based on
the involvement of other people (Mayer et al., 2003).
   The MSCEIT is one of the most commonly used EI tests in the corporate world
in English-speaking countries.



1.4.3 Goleman’s EI Performance Model

Daniel Goleman ignites global interests in the concept of EI with his book Emotional
Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ (1995). In this book, he described
4 basic components of EI: Self-awareness, Other-awareness, self-management and
relationship management. Upon another decade of exploring and researching EI,
Goleman and his colleagues Boyatzis, and researchers from HayGroup in Boston
developed a EI performance model and the Emotional and Social Competency Inven-
tory (ESCI), which measures 12 competencies that contribute to the effectiveness
of organisation performance and leadership (Goleman et al., 2013). Within the four
domains of EI as described in Sect. 1.2, Goleman and his colleagues identified 12
sub-skills in workplace performance that illustrate emotional and social intelligence
and competence. They are:
1.    Emotional self-awareness: the ability to recognise one’s emotions and their
      effects.
2.    Emotional self-control: the ability to keep disruptive emotions and impulses
      in check.
3.    Adaptability: the ability to be flexible in handling change.
4.    Achievement orientation: the ability to strive to improve or meeting a standard
      of excellence.
5.    Positive outlook: the ability to persist in pursuing goals despite obstacles and
      setbacks.
6.    Empathy: the ability to sense others’ feelings and perspectives, and take an
      active interest in their concerns
7.    Organisational awareness: the ability to read a group’s emotional currents
      and power relationships.
8.    Coach and mentor: the ability to sense others’ development needs and
      bolstering their abilities.
9.    Inspirational leadership: the ability to inspire and guide individuals and
      groups.
10.   Influence: the ability to wield effective tactics for persuasion.
11.   Conflict management: the ability to negotiate and resolve disagreements.
12.   Teamwork: the ability to work with others toward shared goals and create
      group synergy in pursuing collective goals.
10                                               1 Understanding Emotional Intelligence

These elements form the basis of the Emotional and Social Competency Inven-
tory, which is used in workplace assessment and staff development in big corpora-
tions worldwide (Wolff, 2005). This inventory measures leadership intelligence and
emphasises the ability to raise awareness through feedback, coaching and developing
others, and to bring out the best in others.
   In addition to these three major models of EI, there is another model that is also
widely accepted in the business world: the Trait EI Model.



1.4.4 The Trait EI Model

Over the last five decades, organisational psychologists have conducted studies to
link the Big Five personality traits with EI. The Big Five Personality Trait Model
is a major component of trait theory in psychology (John & Srivastava, 1999). The
model groups people into five categories:
1.   Openness: the tendency to be open to experience, curious, and inventive.
2.   Conscientiousness: the tendency to be efficient, cautious, responsible, and
     organised.
3.   Extraversion: the tendency to be outgoing, sociable, and energetic.
4.   Agreeableness: the tendency to be sociable, compassionate, and thoughtful.
5.   Neuroticism: the tendency to be sensitive, self-conscious, and generally nervous
     and moody.
At the turn of the century, scholars became more interested in understanding the
connections between personality traits and EI. Petrides et al. (2006) defined this
concept as Trait EI. This theory describes “our perceptions of our emotional world:
what our emotional dispositions are, and how good we believe we are in terms
of perceiving, understanding, managing, and utilizing our own and other people’s
emotions” (Petrides et al., 2018, p. 50).
    Empirical evidence from a large-scale meta-analysis by Judge et al. (2002) shows
that all of the Big Five personality traits, with the exception of agreeableness,
predict leadership. Paunonen and Ashton (2001) also found that some traits are
related to specific leadership capabilities, such as assertiveness, optimism, emotional
expression, perception and people management.
    Whereas the EI ability and competency models are more concerned with the
cognitive component, in comparison, the Trait EI model focuses on the temper-
amental component of emotional competence. Despite deviation between scholars
about the different aspects of these schools of thought, the Big Five have provided the
theoretical basis for measuring EI in the workplace, and for leadership development.
    Meanwhile, educational psychologists investigating connections between traits
and EI in children were able to produce evidence to support the Trait EI theory.
Psychologists in education believe that understanding the construct of personality
traits and EI across an individual’s lifespan, especially in childhood, is important in
assessing developmental milestones. The quest to understand more about children
1.4 Theories and Models of EI                                                       11

and Trait EI progressed, producing evidence that children with higher Trait EI have
better problem-solving skills, are able to maintain better peer relationships (Petrides
et al., 2006), have fewer behavioural problems (Baroncelli & Ciucci, 2014) and show
higher social competence.
    Mavroveli et al. (2008) developed a Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire
(TEIQue-Child Form) to measure personality traits and EI in children in the age
range 8–12. This assessment tool comprises 75 items and measures 15 facets of trait
intelligence. These are:
1.    Adaptability: flexibility and the willingness to adapt to new conditions.
2.    Assertiveness: forthrightness and the willingness to stand up for their rights.
3.    Emotion perception for self and others: the understanding of their own and
      other’s feelings.
4.    Emotional expression: the ability to communicate their feelings to others.
5.    Emotion management: the ability to influence other peoples’ feelings.
6.    Emotion regulation: the ability to control their own emotions.
7.    Impulsiveness: the ability to control urges and impulsivity.
8.    Relationships: the ability to understand and maintain fulfilling personal
      relationships.
9.    Self-esteem: self-confidence and a sense of success.
10.   Self-motivation: self-drive, persistence and the ability to move forward in the
      face of adversity.
11.   Social awareness: the ability to network and show appropriate social skills.
12.   Stress management: the ability to withstand pressure and regulate stress.
13.   Trait empathy: the ability to take another’s perspective.
14.   Trait happiness: cheerfulness and contentment with their own life.
15.   Trait optimism: confidence and the likelihood of having have positive thoughts
      (Mavroveli et al., 2008).
The models and theories presented in this section show us that EI can be understood
and measured in different ways—as an ability, as a competency and as an influ-
ence from our personality traits. They show us that we can make use of emotional
information to guide our thinking and behaviour, and adjust our emotions to adapt
to environments. The EI measurement tools also enable clinical psychologists and
counsellors to identify where an individual falls short in their emotional health and
provide clues to effective intervention, counselling and therapy.



1.5 Why Is EI so Important?

Life in the twenty-first century has become increasingly complex and challenging
in all aspects. In the face of increased social and political problems and pressures
on life in general, people are struggling to cope. According to recent statistics from
the World Health Organisation (2021), 284 million people worldwide (3.76% of the
12                                                  1 Understanding Emotional Intelligence

total population) suffer from anxiety disorders, while 264 million (3.44%) suffer
from depression. And these numbers reflect only those identified and diagnosed.
   In Australia, family violence is on the increase. According to the Australian
Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey 2012, one in four women in Australia
(about 2.2 million) has experienced at least one incident of violence perpetrated by
a male intimate partner. Likewise, one in twelve men (about 694,100) has expe-
rienced violence perpetrated by a female intimate partner (Cox, 2015). More than
three-quarters of these victims said that their children saw or heard of these violent
acts, which had an emotional impact on them as well.
   These statistics show us the importance of being able to understand and manage
our emotions, and of having the ability to control our emotions before they control us,
which can lead to disastrous consequences. They also point to a very strong message:
that the development of EI is as important as, if not more important than, literacy
and numeracy in school education.
   As an essential aptitude and life skill very much needed by everyone in the fast-
paced and pressure-ridden twenty-first century, increased EI will enable us to:
•    enhance our personal growth and self-improvement.
•    understand how emotions impact our health.
•    cope with strong emotions.
•    build healthy family relationships.
•    build positive social and work relationships.
•    make friends and build support.
In contrast, people who are unaware of, untrained in and low on EI will be more
likely to:
•    lose control of their behaviour, especially under stress.
•    get angry easily without realising the source of their anger.
•    behave in self-centred manners.
•    criticise others and bring out the worst in them.
•    engage in negative thoughts most of the time.
•    lack social skills and find it hard to maintain relationships, and get physically sick
     due to a lack of emotional and behavioural control.


1.5.1 EI Enhances Our Personal Growth
      and Self-Improvement

Being emotionally intelligent does not mean you will be happy all the time. We all
experience both positive and negative emotions at different times and in different
situations. What having a good level of EI enables us to do is process information
using rational thought, curb our impulses and cope with challenging times with more
resilience. When we are more aware of and attuned to how our emotions affect us,
we are in a better position to manage them. This enhances our ability to understand
1.5 Why is EI so Important?                                                         13

ourselves better, be more accommodating of and compassionate towards others,
become better communicators and problem-solvers and use better judgement in our
daily lives.



1.5.2 EI Helps Us to Understand How Emotions Impact Our
      Health

Scientists and physicians have produced extensive evidence that our emotions affect
our mental as well as our physical health. Research shows that people who have an
upbeat mental state have more energy, are able to achieve more and are generally
more contented with life (Gross & Thompson, 2007). In contrast, people who suffer
mental health issues such as anxiety and depression are less likely to be aware that
their conditions can be caused or exacerbated by suppressed emotions such as anger
and sorrow, poor personal relationships, or past traumas. Studies have also shown
that people who fail to manage chronic stress tend to suffer from elevated blood
pressure and have high resting heartrates (Krantz & McCeney, 2002), and to be more
susceptible to viruses, infections, and cancers due to weakened immune systems
(Lumley, 2004; Mayne, 2001; Rozanski & Kubzansky, 2005).
   Evidence also shows that individuals with high EI are better at recovering from
acute stress (Ciarrochi et al., 2001; Matthews et al., 2006; Petrides & Furnham, 2003).
These research results suggest that people with well-developed EI have a stronger
ability to maintain their physical and mental wellbeing.



1.5.3 EI Supports Us in Coping with Strong Emotions

Sometimes our emotions can become overpowering and make it difficult for us to
think clearly and rationally. Strong emotions such as anger, anxiety, guilt and shame
can drive us to make poor choices or lose control of the situation we are in. We all
experience sadness, usually associated with the loss of someone or something impor-
tant; if not properly addressed, sadness can lead to depression, physical health prob-
lems and irrational thoughts that can have negative consequences. Developing our
EI and knowing about how our emotions affect our thoughts, attitudes and behaviour
is therefore an essential life skill at all stages of our lives. When we learn how to
manage our emotions and behaviour, perhaps we will find ourselves living in a better
world with less violence, less hatred, and a lot more compassion and support.
14                                                1 Understanding Emotional Intelligence

1.5.4 EI Helps Us to Build Healthy Family Relationships

People with high EI are better able to overcome rifts and strengthen family bonds.
Families are made up of interdependent relationships which change with time and
circumstances; we develop emotional intimacy with our family members from child-
hood, and through warm and nurturing attention and positive communication, parents
with high EI are able to help their children develop strong self-esteem, a good sense of
duty and the ability to make responsible choices. In contrast, parents with low EI are
more likely to be critical, derogatory and punitive, which decreases their children’s
emotional expression and increases relational tensions and negative emotions.
   Parental failure to nurture the emotional growth of their children has been theorised
to be at the root of family aggression and conflict (Straus et al., 2003). Children
growing up in families with low emotional awareness are more likely to have low self-
regulation and impulse control. Psychologists tell us that children acquire emotional
self-control as a result of interaction with their peers and social play. When children
are successful in their negotiation of conflict in childhood, they are likely to be more
socially competent and able to maintain amicable relationships in adulthood.
   We know that ‘and they lived happily ever after’ happens only in fairy tales, and
that no relationship is ever trouble-free. Marriage and romantic relationships need
work to be successful, with both parties contributing to the understanding of the
nuances of feelings and being aware of how their own actions and behaviour impact
others, especially their loved ones (Gabb & Fink, 2015). People with higher EI tend
to be more able to understand their own emotions and those of their partners, and to
make the necessary adjustments to sustain long-term harmonious love relationships.
They have the ability to make good decisions, to bring joy and the calmness needed
to deflect conflict and solve emotional problems to the family. That is why it is
important to start learning EI skills young. If we teach our children the necessary
knowledge and skills while they are young, they will grow up into emotionally
competent individuals.
   Part II of this book focuses on a discussion and exploration of different aspects
of family relationships and EI.



1.5.5 EI Enhances Positive Social and Work Relationships

EI affects our personal as much as our social and work relationships. Meaningful
friendships are determined by not only the beliefs, values and shared interests of the
people involved in them, but also the compatibility of their levels of EI. Valuable
friendships are formed on the basis of mutual trust and emotional intimacy—the
experience of being deeply connected to another person who understands your feel-
ings and what you care about. It requires the willingness to take time to support
another person and make time to keep up the friendship. When we are equipped with
the EI skills that enable us to understand ourselves and others, it is easier for us to
1.5 Why is EI so Important?                                                          15

connect with others and to show empathy and compassion, to share and talk through
our feelings and to feel safe in doing so.
    EI is also an essential quality in workplace success. When we have a good level of
EI, we can interact with our colleagues effectively and develop mutually supportive
work relationships. We are more able to tactfully resolve conflicts and solve people-
or task-related problems. In an organisation that has a high EI culture, employees are
more likely to share affective values, listen to and communicate effectively with one
another and show a genuine interest in supporting each other’s success. In contrast,
in organisations where people display low EI, there is more likely to be a toxic
culture of gossip, professional jealousy, mistrust and an ‘every person for themselves’
attitude. Job satisfaction tends to be low and stress and tension high, and as a result,
productivity decreases.
    Workplace EI has received increasing amounts of attention in the last 30 years.
EI grows and strengthens with time, experience, practice, and insight. It is a lifelong
development. Just as we need the skill of driving a car to navigate the streets of
the modern world, we need EI skills to navigate our way through our journey of
life—in our families, our social interactions and our workplaces. Part III of this book
therefore discusses workplace EI in a broader perspective.



1.5.6 Make Friends and Build Support with Increased EI

Life is full of twists and turns. We make plans and we follow our dreams, and
sometimes things go pear-shaped. From time to time, we experience failure, and this
may lead us to believe that we are stuck and become overwhelmed with feelings of
unfulfillment, discomfort, guilt and shame. It is perfectly fine to feel this way, even
for highly emotionally intelligent people. We all need time and space to heal our
wounds. However, if we are not aware of what these negative emotions are doing to
us, we may fall into depression. This is why we need to form meaningful friendships
and have a network of compassionate support from family and colleagues. When
we are skilled in emotional awareness and management, we can bounce back from
setbacks, seek help from friends and support groups to bring us back to reality and
start again.
   People with weak social support systems are more likely to become withdrawn
and suffer from self-imposed social isolation. For example, isolated older people who
lose their spouses are more likely to experience self-pity and dwell on memories of
the past. Learning to live with the loss of someone you love takes a long time: we all
grieve differently, and it is very hard to readjust to a new life without a spouse who
loved you. However, those who dwell excessively on negative emotions are at higher
risk of developing mental health issues, which will affect them physically too.
   Fortunately, in many of our cities and communities, there are support groups
that exist to bring together people who have gone through similar experiences, from
alcohol and drug addiction support groups and bereavement support organisations to
groups that bring hope through religious activities or meditation, and groups that aim
16                                                      1 Understanding Emotional Intelligence

to bring happiness and joy back to your life. These enable a person who is suffering to
let go and acknowledge the emotions that are preventing them from moving forward.
Friends and relational support are also important to our social health, and EI makes
it is easier to find or establish these support networks at any stage of our lives.
    This chapter has given a broad overview of what EI is, how it is measured and
what the importance and benefits of developing our EI are. The next chapter will
discuss the different features of emotions and how they affect our health and general
wellbeing.

Understanding Emotions




2.1 Introduction

Most people understand emotions as our feelings, moods and affective responses to
people, events, experiences, and environmental challenges. But if you shine a light
down the rabbit hole of scientific studies on emotions, you will find a kaleidoscope
of interests in the scholarly research on the subject in areas including neuroscience,
psychology, medical science and even computer science. In this chapter, we will
explore how emotions are linked to our brains, our bodies, and our spirit (our thoughts
and behaviours).
   Scholars in the human sciences began to take an interest in human emotions in the
nineteenth century. Evolutionist Charles Darwin researched the expression of human
emotion to corroborate his theory of evolution, and in his work The Expression of
Emotions in Man and Animals, proposed that emotions evolved as ways to help
humans adapt, survive, and reproduce. He argued that fear propelled them to fight
or flee to protect themselves, while love and affection led them to seek a mate for
reproduction (Darwin, 2007). Subsequent theorists have endeavoured to understand
emotions further by researching them from different angles: physical, cognitive, and
neurological.



2.2 Emotions and Our Mind, Body, and Spirit

For decades, scientists have considered the limbic system, a complex set of structures
found at the bottom of the frontal lobe and in the inner sections of the temporal lobes
of our brain, to be responsible for our emotional and behavioural responses. This
is generally referred to as the emotional nervous system. It governs not only our
emotional functions but also higher mental functions such as learning and memories.

   Literature on the brain and the emotions describes the four components of the
limbic system as significant parts of the brain that govern our emotions and emotional
responses. They are:
• the cingulate gyrus, which is responsible for coordinating our sensory input
  with our emotions, regulating aggressive behaviour and responses to pain. It
  also affects our language expression, decision-making, maternal bonding, and
  communication.
• the hippocampus, which is responsible for preserving and retrieving memories,
  including both long- and short-term memory, and spatial memory. It helps us to
  understand the spatial dimensions of our environment, and also plays a role in our
  decision-making when we are confronted with strong emotions, and in how we
  handle stress.
• the amygdala, which is responsible for protecting us from danger and drives the
  fight-or-flight response. It plays a crucial role in governing fear and anger. There
  is one amygdala on each side of the brain.
• the thalamus and hypothalamus, which play a crucial role in regulating body
  temperature and emotional responses, controlling the appetite, maintaining the
  body’s daily physiological cycles, and releasing hormones. It also affects our
  moods and happiness.
The brain and our peripheral nervous systems communicate with each other via neural
circuits, which also provide bidirectional communication between the brain and the
heart. Thus, excitement can trigger a rapid increase in heart rate, while a sense of
calmness can slow the heart rate down to provide a sense of relaxation. These mental-
physical communications mutually influence the quality of our mental processing,
and allow our feelings to determine physical changes in our body (Fig. 2.1).



2.2.1 How Traditional Chinese Medicine Explains Emotions
      and Our Body

For over two hundred thousand years, Chinese healers have believed that physical
and mental ailments are caused by imbalances in the energy focus of our body that
they called qi (Tao, 1999). They believe that the seven human emotions—happiness,
anger, sadness, joy, longing, fear and shock affect the health of our five major internal
organs (heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys and liver).
   Traditional Chinese physicians believe that the heart, including the small intestine
(classified as belonging to the element of fire) , is affected by love, joy and happiness.
Feelings of love and affection influence the heart and its relationship to the entire
physical system. Our hearts react to strong emotions such as anxiety, impatience and
hatred, and these emotions can lead to insomnia, palpitations, and other physical
disorders (Holman, 2017).

Fig. 2.1 The Limbic system


   The spleen, which includes the stomach and the pancreas (classified as belonging
to the element of earth), is affected by feelings of fairness, honesty, openness and
trust. When we are bothered by a sense of injustice or unfairness, it will affect the
functions of the spleen, which can cause fatigue, weight loss, bloating and skin
disorders.
   Our lungs, including the skin, and our large intestine (classified as belonging to the
element of metal), are affected by emotions such as fear and fearlessness (courage)
and a sense of righteousness. However, they are also affected by feelings of sadness
and depression. Symptoms associated with these negative emotions include shortness
of breath, asthma, and skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis.
   Our kidneys, including the bladder, and our ears (classified as belonging to the
element of water), are affected by emotions such as calmness and shock. It is believed
that fear affects the adrenal glands as well as the kidneys. When we experience shock
or excessive fear, the adrenal glands secrete adrenalin to trigger a fight-or-flight
response.
   Our liver, including the gall bladder, and our eyes (classified as belonging to
the element of wood), are affected by anger and its associated secondary emotions.
The liver is vital for the release of glucose into the blood. Emotions such as anger,
frustration, jealousy and resentment will affect this function and cause harm to our
body.
   Qigong masters (Chinese healers that practise health and wellness through a form
of Chinese martial art known as qigong) believe that the flow of qi (internal bodily
22                                                             2 Understanding Emotions

energy) is important to our health. When we experience extreme emotions, our qi
(energy) becomes depleted, and we fall sick.
   According to the philosophy of qigong:
•    anger causes the qi to rise, thus causing harm to the liver.
•    joy slows the qi and blood circulation, thus is good for the heart.
•    worry knots the qi, causing concerns to the pancreas and the lungs.
•    shock scatters the qi and will affect the kidney and the heart.
•    sadness knots the qi and will hurt the pancreas.
•    grief (strong sadness) depletes the qi and will harm the lungs.
•    fear depresses the qi and will hurt the kidneys.
People who practice Chinese medicine and qigong believe that the exercises used in
qigong will cause the qi to flow better, leading to improved physical health, while
meditation and the practice of stillness (relaxation) will calm our emotions and bring
back balance to our mental health (Tao, 1999).
Hormones and emotions
Our brain is wired to detect dangers and threats, pleasures and rewards. It is constantly
communicating with the different parts of our body, and to do so it sends chemicals
called hormones from one nerve to another. Medical literature informs us that when
our brain detects a potential threat, it releases stress hormones such as adrenaline
and cortisol to prepare a fight-or-flight response. In contrast, when we experience
something pleasurable or fun, it releases chemicals that make us feel good, such as
dopamine, oxytocin or serotonin.
• Adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) is a chemical produced in the adrenal
  glands and some of the neurons in the central nervous system. It is also known
  as the ‘fight-or- flight hormone’. When we feel stressed, or when we perceive
  danger, the amygdala, which communicates with the rest of the body through the
  sympathetic nervous system, releases adrenaline into the blood. This increases
  blood flow to the brain and muscles and stimulates the body to make sugar for
  fuel, helping the body to react. When this happens, the body also feels less pain,
  which explains why people can continue to run from danger even when injured.
  Adrenaline also causes a temporary increase in strength and performance, and
  heightens awareness.
      When an allergic reaction occurs (such as anaphylaxis), an injection of
  epinephrine (which is artificial adrenaline) will help to relax the muscles blocking
  the airways and enables the patient to breathe normally again.
• Cortisol is a steroid produced by the adrenal glands found on top of each kidney.
  It is mainly released in times of stress. When released into the bloodstream, it can
  help the body to respond to stress or danger by increasing the body’s ability to
  metabolise glucose, reduce inflammation and control blood pressure. The body
  usually produces the right of amount of cortisol, but too much or not enough can
  create health problem. When we experience excessive stress, too much cortisol
  is released in our blood streams, which can lead to fat gain. Some people can
  also develop acne and skin problems, and some women can experience irregular
2.2 Emotions and Our Mind, Body, and Spirit                                        23

  menstrual periods or increased facial hair growth. In contrast, if the body releases
  too little cortisol it can lead to weight loss, muscle weakness, continual tiredness
  and sometimes pain in the abdomen, nausea and vomiting.
• Dopamine is a ‘feel-good’ hormone which leads us to feel pleasure, contentment,
  joy and even motivation. When we achieve something, we experience a surge of
  dopamine in the brain, which leads to a sense of happiness. Dopamine is also
  responsible for governing our moods, our sleep, our learning and concentration,
  and our body movements. The medical literature states that a decrease in natural
  dopamine in the body can contribute to depressive behaviours and conditions such
  as depression, schizophrenia, psychosis and Parkinson’s Disease. However, too
  much dopamine in the brain can cause binge eating, competitive and aggressive
  behaviour, and increased susceptibility to different forms of addictions.
• Oxytocin is also known as ‘the love hormone’. It enables us to feel love and social
  bonds, and has a strong impact on our moods and emotions. When people are in
  love, they experience high levels of oxytocin. So do mothers during childbirth and
  breastfeeding. Scientists have also found that hugging, kissing, cuddling and being
  sexually intimate all trigger oxytocin production. Therefore, increased physical
  intimacy can increase oxytocin levels in people who are sad or depressed, helping
  them to feel better emotionally. Other studies have linked oxytocin with positive
  social behaviours, including positive communication, trust, empathy and social
  bonding. People with low oxytocin levels have been found to have memory prob-
  lems, irregular heartbeats, and mental health disorders including schizophrenia
  and social anxiety disorder.
• Serotonin is another ‘happy hormone’ that stabilises our moods, promoting feel-
  ings of wellbeing and happiness. This hormone is also a neurotransmitter which
  allows our brain cells and other nervous system cells to communicate with each
  other, impacting the entire body. Serotonin also helps to regulate our moods,
  sleeping and eating patterns, and digestion. However, if we are sad or stressed for
  a long period of time, our serotonin levels can become depleted. This may lead
  to loss of appetite, increases in anxiety, irritability, aggressiveness, impulsivity
  and depression, and difficulty in learning due to an inability to concentrate. We
  can increase our natural production of serotonin by exercising regularly, going
  out into the sunlight, eating nutritious food, and practicing relaxation techniques
  such as meditation and yoga.


2.3 Primary and Secondary Emotions

One of the pioneers of the study of human emotion is Paul Ekman, a professor of
psychology at the University of California, San Francisco. He studied the facial
expressions of people from different cultures and identified six basic universal
emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise (Ekman, 1972).
Following years of further studies, Ekman (1999) expanded this list to include
24                                                            2 Understanding Emotions

amusement, contempt, contentment, embarrassment, excitement, guilt, pride in
achievement, relief, satisfaction, sensory pleasure, and shame.
    Concurrently, American psychologist Damasio (1994) classified emotions into
two groups—primary and secondary—based on neurobiological findings. He argues
that primary emotions are innate and support our need to protect ourselves in times
of danger and to fulfil other physical, mental, and social needs. He supported this
theory with findings from his studies on one-year-old children (Damasio, 2004).
Secondary emotions, according to Damasio, involve our thought processes. They are
emotional reactions to other emotions. For example, Damasio argues that jealousy is
as a secondary emotion triggered by fear or anger: when one sibling receives more
attention from the parents than others, the other siblings may feel afraid of losing
their attention, or angry that their parents favour the first sibling.
    Secondary emotions, in other words, are feelings that we have about our primary
emotions. For example, contentment is a primary emotion that is associated with
affection and acceptance, which are secondary emotions. Studies in psychology
suggest that secondary emotions are unconsciously learned and habitual; they are
rooted in our belief systems, and therefore, by changing our beliefs, we can alle-
viate negative secondary emotions. When we understand our primary and secondary
emotions, we can trace our way back to the past experiences that led to the formation
of our current emotions and behaviour, and adjust them.
    The current literature in psychology also points out that primary emotions are
much more straightforward than secondary emotions, as they are direct reactions to
external events, e.g., fear in response to a threat. When the event diminishes, the
primary emotion is likely to recede, whereas secondary emotions tend to continue
long after the event, and may interfere with our ability to cope with the present, e.g.,
anxiety about the possibility of the threat recurring. Secondary emotions are more
complex emotions and can be ambiguous and hard to understand.
    In studies expanding on Damasio’s theory of primary and secondary emotions,
numerous psychologists presented interesting theories and expanded lists of
emotions. One of the best-known ones is Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions (SixSec-
onds, 2017). Plutchik and Kellerman (1980) describe eight basic emotions arranged
in four dyads, which are:
•    sadness and joy.
•    anger and fear.
•    anticipation and surprise.
•    trust and disgust.
In his Wheel of Emotions, he connects basic primary emotions with secondary
emotions, and depicts the dyads in three layers of intensity. For example, sadness
is a primary emotion. When the sadness is less intense, we experience pensiveness.
When it is very intense, we experience grief. These feelings are associated with
disapproval. Table 2.1 summarises the concepts presented in Plutchik’s Wheel.
    Recognising our emotions and learning to manage them can help us to over-
come problems and manage difficulties and setbacks. When we are aware of our
emotions and how they impact us, we can regulate our behaviours more effectively.
2.3 Primary and Secondary Emotions                                                       25

Table 2.1 Emotions described in Plutchik’s wheel
Primary emotion      Less intense emotion    More intense emotion   Associated emotion
JOY:                 serenity                ecstasy                optimism
SADNESS:             pensiveness             grief                  disapproval
ANGER:               annoyance               rage                   contempt
FEAR:                apprehension            terror                 submission
TRUST:               acceptance              admiration             love
DISGUST:             boredom                 loathing               remorse
ANTICIPATION:        interest                vigilance              aggressiveness
SURPRISE:            distraction             amazement              awe



Our emotions become an internal compass, helping us to make decisions about the
situations we are in and figure out what we do and do not want in life. Having the
skills and capability to reflect on our feelings will give us more control over how we
live our lives. If we struggle to recognise negative emotions and negative thoughts,
we are more likely to be unhappy and pessimistic, and to feel helpless and hopeless.
    In contrast, when we become more aware of our own emotions and develop the
skills needed to understand and manage them, we tend to become more aware of
other people’s emotions too. This increases our ability to communicate and build
relationships with others, to better support our family and friends, and to look after
our own and others’ physical and mental health and wellbeing.



2.4 Emotions and Our Cognitive Processes

Our emotions are ubiquitous and complex in nature. They have substantial influ-
ence on cognitive processes including attention, perception, learning, reasoning,
memory and decision-making. It is believed that there are over 100 definitions of
emotions, which are generally referred to as ‘feelings’, ‘moods’, ‘affects’ or ‘affective
reactions’.
   Some scholars have classified them into three distinct groups (Davidson et al.,
2000):
• core affect (or moods).
• emotional episodes (emotional states that do not last very long, e.g., sadness,
  embarrassment).
• affects (trait emotions, describing people who are generally happy, worried,
  depressed, etc.).
Scientists have also found that emotions have a strong influence on our attention
levels, and this influences our ability to learn, because our attentional capacity affects
how much we are able to focus on relevant information. Emotion also affects how
26                                                             2 Understanding Emotions

we store what we have learned in memory and facilitates the retrieval of infor-
mation. Additionally, empirical studies have shown that the amygdala modulates
memory consolidation, the prefrontal cortex influences memory encoding, and the
hippocampus is involved in learning and retention (Talmi et al., 2007; Taylor et al.,
1998; Vogel et al., 2016).



2.4.1 How Our Moods Affect Learning and Memory

A growing interest in the interplay between learning and emotion has been apparent
in the psychology literature of the last two decades. In it, some research scholars have
classified memory into two groups: episodic memory and semantic memory (e.g.,
Nestor et al., 2006; Patterson et al., 2007). Episodic memories are memories that
we capture from daily experiences or special events, (e.g., a first date, watching a TV
show with the kids, cooking a feast for the new year), while semantic memories are
things we store as knowledge, facts and figures (e.g., the alphabet, historical facts
about the Vikings, and E=mc2 ).
    Investigators exploring how emotions affect the way we store and retrieve memory
have found that semantic memories are generally less impacted by our moods
and emotional states than episodic memories, which are strongly associated with
emotions. Empirical evidence has shown that when we are in a positive mood, we
learn better and faster, whereas when we are in a bad mood, the cognitive flexibility
we need to learn new things is reduced (Ashby & Maddox, 2005; Maddox et al.,
2006). Perhaps you have experienced a scenario in which a teacher has spent the first
ten minutes of a class shouting at their students about bad behaviour and destroying
their desire to learn. Half of the children, especially the sensitive ones, are likely to
be raging in their inner voice: “Why shout at me, I didn’t do anything wrong!” Unless
the teacher is able to change the kids’ moods back to a more positive one quickly,
most of them will stay upset and spend the rest of the lesson tuned out, and thus little
learning will take place.
    Other studies also show that when we approach learning in a positive mood, it
increases our mental flexibility and creative problem-solving abilities (Bolte et al.,
2003; Dreisbach, 2006; Dreisbach & Goschke, 2004). This implies that when children
are having fun and experiencing support and encouragement, they will learn better
and achieve more.
    It has also been noted that positive emotions facilitate self-motivation, drive, and
curiosity. However, while we know that excessive stress will impede learning and
memory, some studies also show that mild levels of stress can be motivating in that
they facilitate the urge to learn more (Vogel & Schwabe, 2016). This is influenced
by the attentional state of the individual and the motivation components that induce
curiosity to drive the person to ‘soldier on’ and combat the challenge (Oudeyer et al.,
2016; Vuilleumier, 2005).

2.4.2 Connections Between Emotions, Thoughts, and Beliefs

Our beliefs and thoughts also affect our emotions. People with high EI who are
more in touch with their own emotions tend to have a more positive outlook, and
often feel more empowered to achieve their goals. On the other hand, people who
are less aware of their emotions are more likely to regard themselves as victims of
circumstances or injustice, and hold distorted views of others. They often reinforce
this negativity through their self-talk, repeatedly telling themselves things like “I’m
not good enough”, “I’m a loser” or “I don’t have a rich father like them”. They
tend to overgeneralise, for example when a woman who has been hurt by a selfish
boyfriend asserts that “All men are selfish” and tells herself “I will die an old maid
with no one to love me”. Many people who fall into this pattern of extreme thinking
will push or hold themselves to the extreme, depriving themselves of room for nuance
or growth.
    In contrast, people with low EI are more likely to assume that they are at fault for
other people’s feelings. If they noticed that a friend was unhappy during dinner, they
start to worry, “What did I do or say to make her unhappy?” instead of asking her
what is bothering her. These people tend to feel defensive, and their thought patterns
also prevent them from seeking alternative views. Psychologists have named these
unhealthy thought patterns ‘cognitive distortions’. Having high EI can help people
to avoid such self-blaming thoughts and unhealthy beliefs that others are out there to
harm us, reducing their levels of worry and distress, as when we become more self-
aware and other-aware, we can minimise our tendency to think the negative thoughts
that turn our friends into monsters and our lives into a nightmare.
    There is an ocean of knowledge available about emotions and our cognitive func-
tions. This includes studies of the relationship between motivational and cognitive
processes, emotion and motivation anxiety and attentional bias, and other aspects
of emotions and attention as well as many more on how emotions impact learning,
thinking, motivation, and other cognitive aspects of our emotions. (Bar-Haim et al.,
2009; Carver, 2006; McNally, 1998; Pessoa, 2008; Spielberg et al., 2011). Readers
who are interested can delve more broadly and deeply into these topics.



2.5 The Social Aspects of Emotions

We humans are social animals. We have an innate drive to belong, and we connect
with one another for support. We delight in social acceptance and feel hurt over social
rejection. Our social world has a tremendous impact on our emotions and our general
wellbeing. Theorists studying emotions also claim that our emotions are evolution-
arily adaptive to our social environment (Barrett, 2017; Barrett & Russell, 2015;
Ekman, 2016). Emotions form a huge part of our social self, and our understanding
and experience of our emotions emerges in the context of our social encounters and
relations, whether those be conflict between friends, joy shared around the dinner
28                                                            2 Understanding Emotions

table, or fear during a violent act. Understanding emotions means understanding the
situations and the social environment that produce them.
    In infancy, we are shaped by countless social and cultural factors that influence
the nature of our emotional experiences and emotional expressions. We continue
to develop our social identities and distinctive identity-relevant attitudes throughout
childhood. Our social identities are part of our self-concept, derived from our percep-
tions of our roles in our families, communities and societies. Our social identities
guide how we calibrate our values, attitudes and behaviour according to the iden-
tity standards placed upon us by our cultures, families, and social environments.
This affects how we regulate and express our emotions. Therefore, it is important to
explore the social perspective of emotions if we want to better understand ourselves
and others.



2.5.1 Viewing Emotions with a Social Lens

We form our self-image and self-esteem based on how others treat us and what
we perceive their opinions of us to be. For example, we feel pride and joy when
we are successful in completing a task or attaining a goal. Positive feedback from
others will empower us to become more confident and assertive. However, if we
fail to meet others’ expectations, we can become burdened with negative emotions,
including feelings of insufficiency, unworthiness, guilt or even shame. The social
and emotional qualities of connections with our social environment determine the
quality of our self-identity and social identity.
    Our self-identity (personal identity) is how we perceive ourselves. Having a strong
sense of identity brings us confidence, comfort and security, and these help us to
connect with other people and make good choices. Our social identity, in contrast,
is based on how others perceive us—for example, our gender, race, ethnicity, family
status and role, and our occupation or profession. Our parents and family members
have a strong impact on our identity formation, and the affection or rejection we
experience from members of our families also contributes to the formation of our
identity. Friendship and relationships additionally shape our concepts of who we are,
and become the hallmarks of our identities. We constantly try to confirm both our
self-identities and our social identities in different ways. When our self-conception of
these identities is confirmed by others, we experience positive emotions. Conversely,
when it is neglected or negated, we experience negative emotions. When we expe-
rience excessive social rejection, we tend to feel devalued, and this can threaten our
social identity and our sense of belonging, and undermine our social and emotional
health.
    However, the EI literature tells us about that individuals with low self-esteem tend
to be very sensitive to signals of social acceptance or rejection, and may sometimes
perceive rejection that is not really there. It is therefore important that we develop
the social and emotional intelligence skills that will enable us to tell the difference,
strengthen our communication and relational abilities, and lead a healthy social life.

2.5.2 Cultural Influence on Our Emotions

Culture has significant impact on our social selves. It influences how we understand
and regulate our emotions from infancy. Because culture impacts how emotions are
sensed and expressed in a given cultural context, cultural salience has become a
growing theme in the research on emotions and emotional intelligence. It shapes
people’s behaviour and reactions to different situations.
    Scholars interested in cross-cultural similarities and differences in emotional
perception and expression became more prominent in the early 2000s. While some
earlier researchers (e.g., Fiske et al., 1998; Markus & Kitayama, 1991), found that
in Western cultures people are encouraged express emotions such as excitement
and affection freely, in Eastern cultures people are more likely to value low-arousal
emotions such as calmness, and the control of strong emotions such as anger and
rage (Tsai, 2007). Supporting this assumption, Eid and Diener (2001) presented
empirical evidence that Chinese participants from China and Taiwan in their study
reported lower-intensity negative emotions than Western participants from America
and Australia.
    In a study aimed at understanding how Asian children regard the social accept-
ability of their emotional expressions and how they generally regulate their emotions,
Raval et al. (2007) recruited a sample of 80 children aged between 5 and 8 from
Gujarat on the west coast of India. They wanted to learn about whether the children
thought it was okay to express feelings of anger, sadness and physical pain. What
they found was that a majority of these children felt that it was less acceptable for
them to express anger and sadness than it was to express physical pain. They reported
that when they complained about physical discomfort, they received more attention
from their parents or carers. In contrast, when they felt anger or sadness, most of
them claimed they would sit quietly in a corner to sulk or use facial expressions to
express their emotions rather than verbalising them. Over half of these children also
reported controlling their feelings for fear of being scolded or reprimanded by their
parents, teachers, or other adults.
    Consistent with this finding, a number of other studies have also found that Indian
patients are more likely to report physical symptoms rather than psychological ones
when in distress, and to have higher frequency of somatic reactions to depression
than Western (non-Asian) patients (e.g., Bhui et al., 2017; Conrad & Pacquiao, 2005).
Somatisation is also found to be common among Koreans, who, when under stress,
tend to convert their emotional conflicts into somatic symptoms such as body pains,
shortness of breath, and fatigue (Kim, 1977; Lin, 1983). These studies suggest that
cultural constraints on how we express or suppress our emotions can have harmful
impacts on our physical and mental health. Medical scholars (e.g., Waller & Scheidt,
2006) claim that a lack of knowledge of affect regulation and emotional management
is a major cause of this problem.
    Emotions play a key role in how we relate to others and build relationships. Across
the years, many researchers have found that although many emotions are universal,
some are also deeply culturally influenced. They suggest that, unknowingly, how we
30                                                            2 Understanding Emotions

express or regulate our emotions is strongly shaped by our culture, and that these
‘unwritten codes’ around emotional expression are governed by our culture’s beliefs,
values and cultural expectations.
    Scholars who explore emotions from a cultural dimension often compare individ-
ualistic cultures (e.g., European-American cultures) with collectivist cultures (e.g.,
Asian and some other non-European cultures). Studies have found that American
parents, in general, are more likely to encourage their children to express their
emotions and to believe that suppression of emotion is unhealthy and harmful (e.g.,
Richards & Gross, 2000). In contrast, in Asian cultures, expression of emotions is
more likely to be discouraged, and the ability to keep one’s emotions to oneself is
highly valued (Rothbaum et al., 2000). When a child is in distress, Asian parents
are more likely to ignore the child’s need for comfort and attempt to minimise their
experience of negative emotions by saying things like “Don’t cry, people will laugh
at you!” or to distract the child by giving them a candy or a toy.
    Moreover, American mothers have been found to be keen to encourage their
children to be successful; for example, if their child achieves a high score on their
test, they are likely to make a comment such as “You’re really smart!”. A Chinese
mother, however, would be more likely to either provide neutral feedback or focus
on a task-related comment, such as “Did you know all the questions, or did you just
guess some of them?” In this scenario, the American mothers are ‘up-regulating’
their children’s emotions, while the Asian mothers are ‘down-regulating’ them (Ng
et al., 2007).
    Cultural differences in the expression of emotions are also intriguing. For example,
happiness is an emotion that most people desire. Yet, there are subtle difference
between individualistic and collective cultures in terms of how it should be expressed.
For example, David, an Australian vet working in the Hong Kong government, went
to work one day happy as a lark. His boss asked, “How are you, Dave?” and he
replied, “Outstanding!”. David was immediately advised by his boss that in the
Chinese culture, such a response would be interpreted as ‘arrogant’ because it would
make the others feel dull, and the usual (accepted) reply should be ‘Okay la’ or
‘So-so’. Moderation is virtue!
    In a study on anger expression, Haidt and Keltner (1999) also found cultural
differences. For example, they found that Indian youths are more likely to express
their anger amongst friends and family, while American youths would express their
anger publicly, through road rage, standing up for a friend, or having disturbed by
noise from their neighbours.
    Mesquita (2001) also noted some apparent differences between expressions
of emotional in individualistic and collectivist cultures. Her observations are
summarised in Table 2.2.
    As illustrated in Sects. 2.5.2 and 2.5.3, culture affects both our appraisal of our
own emotions and the coping strategies we use to manage them. This suggests that the
focus of emotion-coping strategies differs depending on whether we use an internal
locus of coping (reliance on the self) or an external locus of coping (reliance on
others). Researchers have pointed out that individuals with bi-cultural backgrounds
(e.g., immigrants moving from a collectivist culture to a more individualist one) are

Table 2.2 Collectivist and individualist emotions
Collectivist emotions                            Individualist emotions
• Strong attention to the impact of other        • Less focus on the impact on relative social
  people’s behaviour on relative social          position
  positions
• Show concerns for one’s own social worth       • Focus on personal concerns only
  and the worth of the in-group
• The social worth of different people is        • One is responsible for one’s own action
  perceived as interconnected. For example, if
  someone did something embarrassing, the
  embarrassment will be regarded as an insult
  to the family or the group
• Social sharing of emotions ensures that        • Social sharing is usually informational or
  others share in the concern and behave         about events
  accordingly. For example, Cousin Tom is
  engaged, how will that affect us?
• Focused on relationships and action            • Focus on self, therefore, less regard for action
  readiness is keen                              readiness (to help or support)



better able to cope with emotional distress because they have two different sets of
skills. For example, Kiefer (1974) found that second-generation Japanese Americans
have two different coping repertoires that they could use to meet the demands of their
different cultural contexts. Likewise, Aboriginal Australian children in the same time
frame appeared to use two different sets of strategies to cope with the demands of
their parents in their traditional culture, and of Western teachers at school (Davidson
et al., 1978).
    Developing our EI can help us to understand more about our own needs and
concerns despite cultural differences and changes. With a better understanding of
how our emotions affect us and how we respond emotionally to others’ demand, we
will be able to cope better with the demands of modern life and develop stronger
resilience and emotional competence.



2.5.3 The Benefits of Developing Social-Emotional
      Intelligence

Renowned professor of psychology Bar-On maintains that having social-emotional
intelligence (SEI) is important to our personal development. It helps us to understand
and express ourselves effectively, to relate to others better, and to successfully cope
with daily demands and challenges. People with high SEI can manage personal,
social, and environmental change flexibly by both coping with the immediate
situation and making wise choices and decisions.
    Students who have received training and development in SEI skills have been
found to be able to perceive and appraise their emotions more effectively and are
32                                                                     2 Understanding Emotions

more proficient in regulating them and establishing better relationships with others
(Cherry et al., 2012). In the last 20 years, scholars in the field have therefore designed
and delivered programs for teaching SEI practices and therapeutic interventions (e.g.,
Berenson et al., 2008; Cherry et al., 2012; Collins, 2013; Fuentes et al., 2014; Maree
et al., 2013; Ning et al., 2012). These studies have provided proof that students who
take SEI programs at school are better able to manage their academic performance,
make sound choices about their personal and social decisions and show positive
attitudes towards themselves and others. They also indicated that these young people
showed enhanced self-efficacy, increased self-confidence, more persistence in their
tasks, more empathy when connecting with peers, and a greater ability to articulate
their goals and sense of purpose. They showed reduced risk-taking behaviours and
emotional stress both at school and at home. Their grades improved, their class
attendance became regular, and they had reduced conduct problems (Farrington et al.,
2012; Sklad et al., 2012).
    Educators believe that training teachers to explicitly teach social and emotional
skills is an important part of teacher education and professional development
(Merrell & Gueldner, 2010; Zins et al., 2004). Teachers can be shown ways to foster
such skills in students through their interpersonal and student-centred instructional
interactions throughout the school day (Williford & Wolcott, 2015). Teachers who
are skilled and knowledgeable in SEI are also able to provide emotional support and
generate opportunities and experiences to promote student engagement and student
autonomy throughout the educational process. Finally, the school community can
also reinforce learned SEI skills by providing students with additional opportunities
to refine and apply them (Catalano et al., 2004).
    Part VI of this book will discuss in more depth how teachers and parents can
enhance children’s EI and SEI both at school and at home.

Functions of Emotions




3.1 Introduction

Emotions are the colours in the tapestries of our lives. They can be positive, feel-
good ones like happiness, love and pride, or negative, irksome ones, like sadness,
embarrassment or anger. Some people claim that there are no positive or negative
emotions. We just need to accept them as we experience them. However, we do
experience emotions that are not very pleasant, thus, in this book, the term ‘negative
emotions’ is still used. Unpleasant emotions can be fleeting, like a burst of irritation
at a co-worker, or long-lasting, like the enduring grief over the loss of a relationship
or someone dear. They can distract us from our work, drain our ability to focus or
recall information and compel us to act irrationally, leading to distressing or even
devastating consequences. So why do we have them? Why do we get emotional?
What should we do when we experience powerful emotions that lead us out of
control? Are there good and bad emotions? How do they affect us?
    When we interpret emotions through a functional lens, we can improve our ability
to identify them as we experience them, and make informed choices about whether or
not they are helpful to us in particular situations. This chapter discusses the functions
of our emotions, using findings from both scholarly articles and empirical studies
to illustrate their different functions and how they impact our lives. It also discusses
how we respond to our emotions, and the defensive mechanisms we use to cope with
unpleasant ones.



3.2 An Evolutional Interpretation of the Functions
    of Emotions

Decades of research insights have progressively increased our knowledge of how
our emotions function. In 1872, Charles Darwin declared that from an evolutionary
perspective, they were biologically rooted and existed to propel people to respond

their missions in life. For example, fear pushed our ancestors to run from man-eating
beasts, or to fight off others who came to steal their food or possessions. Frustration
pushed them to invent the wheel. Grief at loss of lives prompted them to build
structures to protect their families from fierce animals and stormy weather.
   Darwin also suggested that emotions helped early humans to communicate and
bond with others. Communication is vital in establishing social relationships and
social cohesion, and ancient cave paintings and carved symbols trace the evolution
of human expression of emotions and show us how our ancestors communicated with
one another. Incorporating his observations of and studies on human psychology and
adaptive behaviour, Darwin put forward three principles about the origins of human
emotions.
   They are:
1.   The principle of serviceable habits: In order to survive, people developed
     different emotions which were reinforced over time, such as disgust. A feeling
     of disgust, triggered via sight, smell or taste, plays a key role in stopping us from
     drinking dirty water, eating poisonous or rotten food and getting too close to
     sick people, vomit and dangerous situations. So, disgust serves a useful function
     for us—it protects us from potential health threats.
2.   The principle of antithesis: People (and some animals) express emotions
     physically, through facial expressions and/or body gestures. When contrasting
     emotions are present, the physical expression will be the opposite of the first.
     Darwin used the example of a man who, when confronted with something chal-
     lenging, takes a firm stance with shoulders squared, chest jutted out and muscles
     tensed up to show that he is ready to act. When no signs of danger are present,
     however, the same man will react by shrugging his shoulders and stretching out
     his open arms to show that there is nothing to worry about. When this man feels
     proud, he looks up and expands his chest to express it, when he feels ashamed
     he covers his face and drops his shoulders.
3.   The principle of involuntariness (nervous discharge): When people experi-
     ence an intense emotion such as fear, there is a build-up of energy that results
     in a nervous discharge such as screaming or trembling. Equally, when we feel
     sorrow, we cry.
        Early studies of the evolutionary aspects of emotions give rise to some under-
     standing of emotions, not only in humans but also in animals. The study of human
     and animal facial expressions and postures is still a rich source of information
     about emotions. However, an explosion of research on the topic has taken place
     since Darwin’s era, and consequently, contemporary scientists hold different
     views of human emotions than Darwin.

3.3 Alternative Views on the Functions of Emotions

Congruent with Darwinian views on evolution and emotional development, Robert
Plutchik (Plutchik & Kellerman, 1980) considers emotions to be similar to traits,
and claims that they are “basic adaptations needed by all organisms in the struggle
for individual survival” (p. 145). He suggests that emotions are associated with
behaviours, and ‘emotion’ is a term used to describe these adaptative behaviours.
As noted in Chapter 2, Plutchik has identified eight basic emotions, namely fear,
anger, joy, sadness, acceptance, disgust, expectancy, and surprise. Readers interested
in more in-depth discussion of the functions of emotions are encouraged to read the
works of Plutchik. Table 3.1 summarises Plutchik’s explanation of how emotions
lead to specific adaptative behaviours.
   However, the Darwinian, evolutionary view of the functionality of emotions has
largely been replaced by a number of alternative theories. One of them, proposed
by James Averill (1983), is that emotions are not merely biological, and that some
emotions do not involve physical reactions at all. Averill identifies emotions as social
phenomena that can be understood from a dispositional or schematic aspect instead.
He considers both emotions and traits to be human dispositions, and categorises
emotions as short, temporary mental states that a person experiences (e.g., anxiety
and fear), which are different from personality traits (e.g., neuroticism), when a
person with such a disposition would be prone to suffer long-term anxiety.
   Averill also believes that emotions are parts of the cognitive schemas (concepts,
beliefs, goals and plans) which help us to make sense of our experiences and guide our
behaviours. Some of these schemas are legacies from our evolutionary past, while
others are shaped by our cultures and are products of our individual experiences.
They teach us about our social roles and how to behave in accordance with social
norms and social expectations. Importantly, however, Averill argues that schemas

Emotion        Adaptative behavior
Fear           Protection: in response to pain or threat

Joy            Reproduction: maintenance of contact, act of
               sexual pleasure

               seek pleasure or nutrient
Acceptance     Incorporation: The acceptance of a stimulus
Disgust        Rejection: the removal of something unpleasant or harmful
Expectancy     Exploration: to respond to the urge to examine the environment
Surprise       Orientation: stopping or freezing to understand what is happening, to decide if
               something beneficial or harmful is taking place
40                                                            3 Functions of Emotions

are not static, but dynamic, and undergo continual and dramatic changes during the
course of an emotional episode.
   Other studies on emotion argue that all emotions are closely linked to behaviours
and action tendencies. Our emotions affect our perception, attention, learning,
memory, choice, physical reactions, and behavioural decision-making. They also
activate certain systems in our body and deactivate others, enabling coordinated
responses to stimuli. For example, when someone is anxious or scared, their diges-
tive system slows down, reducing saliva production: thus, they get a dry mouth. At
the same time, their heart rate increases to pump more blood to their muscles and
brain, their lungs take in more air to give the body more oxygen and their pupils
dilate so that they can see better in order to run away (Borgomaneri et al., 2014;
Hansen & Hansen, 1988; Öhman et al., 2001; Pinkham et al., 2010; Schutter et al.,
2008; Van Loon et al., 2010).
   Emotions, in other words, are waves of energy that flow through our minds and
bodies to help us to understand how we connect with ourselves, our environment
and our family and friends, and how we build and maintain relationships. How much
do you know about the different aspects of your emotions? How good are you at
recognising your emotions and those of others?



3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions

Our emotions point to our underlying needs and desires, and different emotions affect
us differently at different times. Having a better understanding of how these emotions
affect us and others can help us to become more motivated, rescue ourselves from
destructive thought and behaviour patterns, and become better and happier people.
The following sections present research findings on some of the core emotions we
need to understand in order to do this.



3.4.1 Happiness and Joy

Happiness is a much-sought-after positive emotion, which is also described as
contentment, amusement or joy. Although these terms are used as synonyms most
of the time, they are felt and explained in different ways by different people. For
example, some argue that happiness is a state attained when a desire is met, whereas
contentment is the elevated spirit we feel when we are naturally free from desire
(Fredrickson, 2013; Kragel & LaBar, 2013).
   Happiness was described by early philosophers Aristotle and Plato as hedonic and
eudemonic. Hedonic happiness (hedonism) is the pursuit of pleasure and the avoid-
ance of with the motivational component of enjoyment while eudemonic happiness
(eudemonism) is a state of inner peace and harmony a joy obtained through self-
actualising experiences and self-achievement. Other scholars have suggested that
3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions                                          41

happiness is the primary emotion that elicits other feelings such as amusement,
contentment, interest, curiosity, fun, silliness, intimacy, relief and calmness. Happi-
ness can reduce negative feelings such as anxiety, worry, sadness and arousal, espe-
cially when bonding with others. Some researchers have also found that happiness can
increase mental abilities such as verbal working memory, cognitive flexibility, cogni-
tive control, and increased working memory capacity (Ashby et al., 1999; Berridge &
Kringelbach, 2013; Deci & Ryan, 2008; Ekman & Cordaro, 2011; Fredrickson, 2013;
Storbeck & Maswood, 2016; Suardi et al., 2016).
    Social scientists Forest et al. (1979) argued that when we are happy, we are more
likely to show empathy to others through acts such as helping a stranger. Scientific
data have also shown that such acts of kindness associated with a happy state of mind
are driven by the neurochemical change caused by increased levels of dopamine and
oxytocin in our brains. Other psychology writers have also suggested that happiness
fosters behavioural changes that enhance social bonding and attachment, promote
trust and prosocial behaviour and boost cooperation and support (Baron et al., 1990;
Christie & Friedman, 2004; Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005; Shiota et al., 2017; Tsai et al.,
2002).
    Our personality traits and how we respond to happiness also seem to have implica-
tions for how we respond to relational demands. The extensive literature on the study
of happiness and relationships agrees that a person’s state of happiness can affect
their marriage and relationship satisfaction, their sense of self-worth and self-esteem,
and their help-seeking behaviours. In essence, happiness facilitates relational bonds
and fosters a sense of wellbeing, which has a cyclical effect as it prompts people
to develop more quality relationships, leading to more joy. (Cacioppo et al., 2008;
Johnson & Fredrickson, 2005; Lucas et al., 2003).
    We all seek out happiness and peace because they make us feel good. However, the
concept of happiness is not the same in every culture. Tsai et al. (2006) found that
people in individualistic cultures (e.g., most modern Western cultures) seek high-
stimulation forms of happiness, such as excitement, success, a sense of achievement,
social status or wealth. In contrast, Eastern cultures (and other communal cultures)
tend to seek low-stimulation forms of happiness such as physical comfort and health
and feelings of peace, wellbeing and calmness. While people in Western cultures
pursue satisfaction through winning competitions, protecting their individual free-
doms and self-interest, climbing the corporate ladder or breaking glass ceilings,
people in collective cultures are more likely to find joy in looking after the social
wellbeing of their fellow countrymen, their extended families, the environment and
life sources in nature. Joshanloo (2014) describes the West as self-focused and the
East as self- transcendent.


3.4.1.1   Joy

Joy is thought to be a deeper emotion than happiness. Harvard psychology professor
Dan Gilbert has explained the difference by saying that when you win the lottery, for
example, you experience happiness, but when you give birth to a child, you experience
42                                                               3 Functions of Emotions

joy. We experience joy when we care for others, when we feel thankful and when
we attain inner peace and contentment. While happiness is a momentary experience,
joy is long-lasting. Joy is also associated with spiritual experiences such as feeling
close to god. It can also come as a sudden burst of happiness—an experience like
riding an elevator to a higher level of happiness.
    Joy is also associated with hope (Wright, 2015). When we have been longing
for something to happen and the day finally arrives—for example, when we learn
about the end of a war or pandemic—we experience a sense of joy. Joy is also expe-
rienced when a good event is better than anticipated: for example, getting not only
promotion but also a company car and free accommodation in a luxury apartment.
We also experience joy when we achieve triumph after a long period of struggle—
e.g., winning a court case—or a sudden change in our life fortunes, e.g., by finding
happiness in relationships after the loss of someone dear (Wright, 2015). And joy
can be associated with pride: we feel happy, proud and joyful when we win a contest
or get the promotion we worked so hard for.
    Joy and happiness are self-conscious emotions. We feel them only when we are
aware that we are happy and joyful. Some people with specific psychiatric conditions
are not able to recognise happiness or feel joy even when others create such oppor-
tunities for them. This inability to gain pleasure from happy experiences is known as
anhedonia, and is a clinical feature of depression, schizophrenia and other mental
illnesses.
    When we feel joyful, we know our lives are going well. We feel thankful, and we
generally become kinder and more helpful towards others.



3.4.2 Sadness and Depression

Psychologists argue that people experience two types of pain: physical pain and social
pain. When we are injured or suffering from an illness, we experience physical pain.
Social pain, on the other hand, is caused by feelings with negative consequences
that are related to psychological distance from other people (Chen et al., 2008;
MacDonald, 2009). Sadness and depression are forms of social pain that are also
associated with physical suffering.
    Sadness is a form of emotional pain hard to described with words. An example
of a definition is that it is a transient emotional state characterised by feelings of
disinterest, disappointment, dampened mood, hopelessness and grief. Sadness is a
healthy emotional response, part of the ups and downs of life, and it serves to inform
us of what is important to us and signals our need for care and compassion. Sadness
tells us that we are unable to achieve a goal or a desire, and it motivates us, triggering
us to make more of an effort to deal with the challenges we are facing and prompting
us to make choices that will improve our lives (Moors et al., 2013; Qiao-Tasserit
et al., 2017).
3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions                                           43

    Sadness can be expressed in many different ways, including crying, lethargy,
quietness and withdrawal from others. It is perhaps the most common feeling asso-
ciated with grief, but it can also be caused by relational conflict, feeling pressure
at work or at home, or being ill or watching someone you love suffer illness. It is
not a passive emotion; it can lead us to a cognitive restructuring as we think about
the causes and consequences of our sadness. Many of us are even motivated by sad
experiences to develop resilience and become stronger (Cooper & Shallice, 2006;
Watkins & Teasdale, 2001).
    Sadness is often triggered by the feeling of loss. Losses that trigger sadness can
include the loss of a sense of safety, the loss of love, the loss of employment or status
and the loss of possessions, pets, and people dear to us. Losing someone suddenly
can be shocking and traumatic, especially when it is an accident, and grief for a loss
can be experienced as a sense of emptiness or despair. Overcoming such grief can
take a long time, as the amount of time spent in grief depends on the personality
of the individual and how attached they were to the person they have lost. Severe
reactions to traumatic loss caused by death can even change a person’s behaviour,
and lead to relational breakdown if it is not handled well. It is therefore important
that bereaved people receive kindness and support from their network of family and
friends (Bonanno et al., 2005; Nezlek et al., 2008).
    Sadness also shows us that we have empathy for others. Children, for example,
can feel sad for characters they read about in books (Levine, 1995), and adults too
often shed a tear or two in response to sad stories in the news or struggling characters
in a movie. And eventually, we all come back from feelings of sadness and grief.
But extended periods of sadness may lead to depression, which is a more prolonged
state.


3.4.2.1   Depression

Depression is a potentially life-threatening mental disorder, which can occur at any
age. It can fall into a few different categories, the most common being major depres-
sion. People clinically diagnosed with major depression show depressive symptoms
that interfere with their ability to work, study, sleep, eat and enjoy life throughout
most of the day for at least two weeks. These can include feelings of hopelessness
or extreme pessimism, an overwhelming sense of emptiness and persistent feelings
of anxiety. Physically, people with depression may feel a loss of energy, fatigue,
difficulty concentrating, remembering or decision-making, sleep disturbances or
insomnia, or oversleeping and not wanting to get up. Some may also experience
changes in appetite or weight, digestive problems, aches and pains with unknown
causes, and even thoughts of suicide (Burnam et al., 2011). The 2012 World Mental
Health Survey found that on average about 1 in 20 people in 17 countries reported
experiencing an episode of depression in the previous year (WHO, 2012), and the
number of people with depression is growing globally.
   Another form of depression is perinatal depression, which can be experienced
by women during pregnancy or after giving birth. Women with perinatal depression
44                                                            3 Functions of Emotions

feel overwhelmed, anxious, irritable and angry for no identifiable reason. They may
become weepy and feel sad all the time, or feel intensely worried about the baby but
have no energy to tend to it, leading them to feel guilty and worthless. Some may lose
interest in their newborn due to the degree of physical and psychological discomfort
they are experiencing. They may also experience headaches and chest pain, or feel that
they cannot breathe properly (hyperventilation). This may be caused by a chemical
imbalance in the brain and body during pregnancy. Luckily, over 90% of women who
experience perinatal depression recover within weeks, particularly when treated with
medication or psychotherapy (Ng et al., 2010; Stuart-Parrigon & Stuart, 2014).
    A third common form of depression is seasonal affective disorder (SAD). A small
number of people who live in countries that are usually cold, dark and gloomy,
without much sunshine in winter, have been found to suffer from major depressive
episodes during the winter months but recover in spring and summer when they have
access to more daylight. Scientists attribute this to hormones, neurotransmitters in
the brain and body, and genetic and other psychological factors. Treatment with light
therapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy have proven to be effective in helping
people with SAD (Lambert et al., 2002).
    Yet another common form of depression discussed in the literature is psychotic
depression. This is a type of depression found in people who have both severe depres-
sion and some form of psychosis such as delusions or hallucinations (hearing or
seeing things that others cannot hear or see). These problems have been found to be
associated with neuro-psychological factors and chemical imbalances in the brain.
    Depression, in other words, is a complex condition that can be triggered by situ-
ational events, genetic factors or chemical imbalances in the human body. However,
it can be treated, and people with depression can get better with a combination of
medical treatment, psychotherapy, and most importantly, support from family and
friends.



3.4.3 Pride and Embarrassment

While pride is seen as a positive emotion in most Westernised cultures, in some
others, it is considered undesirable and even a sin. But what does pride tell us? What
can we learn from feeling proud? Is pride a good thing or a bad thing?
   Poggi and D’Errico (2010) identified three types of pride:
1.   Dignity pride: when one is in the state of being dignified or worthy of respect
     and appreciation.
2.   Superiority pride: when one feels that winning makes one stronger and will
     elevate one’s social status. People feeling superiority pride think they are
     stronger, better than and superior to others.
3.   Arrogance pride: when one believes that one has power over others but does not
     acknowledge the power or ability of others. At times, people feeling arrogance
     pride may engage in abusive actions to belittle others.
3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions                                         45

Tracy and Robins argue that pride has an adaptive function that might have evolved
to provide information about the individual’s current level of social status and accep-
tance (Tracy & Robins, 2007). Tracy (2016) also explains that pride can be both
healthy and unhealthy. Healthy pride is a sign of self-confidence, and presents a
positive notion of self- worth. When we feel a healthy sense of pride, it tells us
that we are not satisfied with a mediocre performance and want to do better. It is a
genuine feel-good emotion that is not driven by a need to compete with others or to
put them down. On the other hand, unhealthy pride is associated with a strong ego
and an amplified sense of self-worth. Unhealthy pride is an aggressive declaration
of personal superiority in order to inflate one’s self-image. People who constantly
display superiority pride or arrogance pride are usually defensive and authoritarian
in their behaviour, suggesting that under the surface they may actually feel insecure.
    Supporting this view, Kaufman et al. (2018) noted that people who exhibit
unhealthy pride are generally antisocial and engage in rule-breaking behaviour. They
assume that they know more than others, but actually have a myopic perspective that
is characterised by self-righteousness and a sense of power over others. People who
indulge in long-term arrogance pride may develop into narcissists who relentlessly
manipulate their power in order to feed their egos with grandiose plans. This may
lead to unconscious behaviour disorder.


3.4.3.1   Embarrassment

Embarrassment tells us that we have violated some social conventions or norms,
making us feel unpleasant. This could be a minor error that we can laugh off, or
a painful experience such as public humiliation, which can cause restlessness, loss
of appetite and insomnia. We feel embarrassment because we are conscious of the
social rules around us and not indifferent to them or cold-hearted about making social
missteps. Embarrassment is sometimes accompanied by physiological changes such
as blushing, sweating or stammering.
   Some people are more prone to embarrassment than others, especially those who
are sensitive or who experience social anxiety. On the other hand, there are some
people who rarely feel embarrassment. These people tend to have high levels of
self-confidence and self-esteem, and can easily laugh off a small social blunder.
However, people who are generally arrogant or apathetic do not feel embarrassment
easily, and when they do, are likely to display defensive behaviour to cover up
their emotions. Some people are unable to understand the feelings of others, and
are therefore less responsive to the feeling of embarrassment; these people may be
diagnosed as psychopaths.
   Sometimes it is hard to overcome embarrassment, especially embarrassment that
is related to humiliation. But overcoming embarrassment can help us build our
resilience. We can engage in supportive self-talk and affirm to ourselves that we are
not overreacting. After all, the feeling of embarrassment that bothers you is solely in
your head. If you let it go and stop thinking about it, you can gain perspective on the
46                                                              3 Functions of Emotions

mistake you have made and move forward from it. It is not easy, and can take time,
but you can be kind to yourself and forgive your missteps. It is part of self-growth.



3.4.4 Guilt and Shame

Guilt and shame share very similar characteristics. They are both unpleasant emotions
and are considered self-conscious ones. They encompass feelings of distress that are
elicited by one’s perception of having failed or transgressed. Intense feelings of guilt
and shame over a long period of time can be associated with psychological disor-
ders such as depression, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
(Andrews et al., 2000; Orth et al., 2006; Tangney & Tracy, 2012).
   Wilson et al. (2006) argue that guilt comprises negative emotions related to wrong-
doings or perceived failures to act appropriately, whereas shame is a negative evalu-
ation of one’s own worth in the wake of acting “wrongly”. According to this concep-
tualisation, guilt is concentrated on one’s actions, while shame is directed toward
one’s moral integrity and self- worth, and how one is perceived by others. In addi-
tion, shame includes feelings of disgrace, dishonour, loss of self-esteem, loss of
virtue and loss of personal integrity (Wilson et al., 2006).
   Many trauma survivors feel guilt, and blame themselves for ‘causing’ the trauma.
For example, a rape victim may feel that she caused the rape by dressing in a certain
way, or children of abusive parents that they were abused because they behaved badly
(Kubany & Manke, 1995). In a study on college students’ emotional responses to
different types of trauma, Amstadter and Vernon (2008) found that students who
experienced sexual and physical assault felt a higher level of guilt than those who
experienced traffic accidents or other physical injuries.
   They also found that these students’ guilty thoughts led to negative emotional
responses such as distress, uneasiness and anger, and that these feeling were often
accompanied by the desire to go back to the past and undo the wrong (Pitman et al.,
1991).


3.4.4.1   Shame

Shame is a multifaceted emotional experience that includes emotional, physical,
behavioural, social-cognitive and internal self-evaluative components. The emotional
component comprises self-disgust, anger and anxiety. The physical component
comprises blushing and changes in sleeping patterns, appetite and bodily stress. The
behavioural component involves avoidance (of eye contact or social interactions),
aggressive behaviour and a desire for revenge (Gilbert, 2002).
   Researchers claim that self-conscious emotions such as shame, guilt, pride and
embarrassment can only occur when an individual has a sense of self-awareness and
self-esteem (Gilbert, 2011; Lewis, 1998; Tracy & Robins, 2007). The consciousness
of shame emerges in infancy, at around the age of 18–24 months, becomes more
3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions                                         47

evident when children reach the ages of 3–6 and begin to learn more about rules,
goals and standards. Barrett et al. (1993) found that young children aged 3–6 would
hide a toy they broke or make an effort to ‘mend’ it, demonstrating shame-relevant
behaviour. However, most children do not understand shame in the way that adults
do until the age of seven or older. Some researchers have also found that children
with Autism Spectrum Disorder are less likely to feel shame due to differences in
cognitive ability (Griffin, 1995; Lewis, 2000).
   Higgins et al. (1986) argue that shame is interpreted from two perspectives: a
personal perspective (what you believe in) and another perspective (what others who
are important to you believe in). They claim that we evaluate ourselves from six
standpoints:
1.   actual/own: your actual self against your own expectations of yourself.
2.   actual/other: your actual self against others’ expectations of you.
3.   ideal/own; your ideal self against your own expectations of yourself.
4.   ideal/other: your ideal self against others’ expectations of you.
5.   ought/own: what you ought to be or do according to your own expectations.
6.   ought/other: what you ought to be or do according to others’ expectations.
People compare their actual selves to internalised social standards and norms: the
ideal and ought self. When there is a discrepancy in meeting these expectations, they
feel emotional discomfort in the form of shame, guilt, or embarrassment.
   In their study of shame and guilt, Tracy and Robins (2006) asked students to indi-
cate how they felt about their school grades and exam results. Their findings suggest
that students who attributed their low grades to their ability (an internal, uncontrol-
lable factor) were more likely to express shame, while those who attributed their
low grades to their lack of effort (an internal, controllable cause) were more likely
to express guilt instead. Similarly, Yi and Baumgartner (2011) surveyed impulsive
shoppers and found that those who expressed shame attributed the behaviour to their
inability to control themselves, e.g., “My impulse buying reflects my weak self”,
but those who expressed guilt linked the temptation to the ‘unbeatable discount’ and
‘sales promotion’ e.g., “I got temporarily carried away by a discount”, attributing
their impulsivity to situational and short-term factors.
   Shame is also related to a sense of inferiority. People tend to feel inferior and
easily shamed when they do not live up to their expectations of themselves—ideal
self or ought self. This can include issues such as body image, academic or work
success, financial achievement, social status, and moral standards. Cultural elements
also play a part. For example, it is a common phenomenon in Asian cultures to admire
people who attain a high social and financial status. This is why many Asians like to
dress in expensive brands and drive expensive cars. This pattern is evident in many
high schools in Australia: a middle-class Asian student driving a second-hand Toyota
would feel embarrassed, or even ashamed, when parking next to the lucky classmate
who got a brand-new Mercedes as a birthday present, while in contrast, a non-Asian
student two spaces down in the same car park would be more likely to feel pride even
in a $500 ‘bomb’ if it was paid for with money earned at a part-time job.

3.4.5 Anger and Frustration

We all experience anger from time to time. Anger is a sign that we have been hurt,
that our needs have not been met, that our demands and expectations have not been
realised, that our rights have been violated, or just that events have surprised us in
an unpleasant way. Williams (2017) argues that anger is an inborn sense developed
early in life, and is natural and universal. But anger can also degrade communication
and threaten friendships. Throughout our childhood we develop ways to express our
anger: while some learn calm and composed reactions, others turn to aggressive
or violent behaviour. If we are not taught as children how to deal with our anger
responsibly, we can mess up our relationships with friends and loved ones through
inappropriate expressions of anger.
   To understand anger, we must be aware of its three dimensions: physical, cogni-
tive/emotional, and behavioural. In the physical dimension when we feel anger we
experience changes in our physical state. Our breath gets shorter, our heart rate
increases, and our blood pressure may rise. Some of us turn red in the face; some
stutter or raise their voices. Cognitively, anger may cloud our minds and make it
hard to think rationally, which can create an intense and sometimes uncontrollable
emotional state that produces undesirable behaviour such as swearing, hitting or
destructive acts (Williams, 2017).
   Some psychologists connect anger to personality traits and believe that people with
certain traits such as neuroticism are more prone to anger and hostility (Barefoot,
1992; Buss & Perry, 1992; Cook & Medley, 1954). Spielberger et al. (1985) suggest
that there are two kinds of anger: healthy and unhealthy anger. Unhealthy anger
comprises three elements: anger, hostility, and aggression. The authors argue that
while anger is an emotional state that is mainly intrapersonal (i.e., directed at the self
and at circumstances that affect the self), hostility is ‘other-directed’. People who are
chronically angry and hostile are likely to have lived through traumatic experiences
which have shaped their personality, making them more likely to be cynical, unable
to build trust in others and suspicious that people are out to hurt them or cause them
harm. Some may engage in withdrawal behaviours, while others can be aggressive,
hot-tempered, or even violent. Those who experience unhealthy anger tend to have
higher levels of anger and frequently feel hatred, sadness, resentment and fear. They
are also more likely to employ destructive behaviours to vent their feelings.
   Cook and Medley (1954) developed the Ho Scale Personality Inventory to learn
more about anger and hostility. The selected examples from the scale listed below
will give you an insight of what hostility looks like:
• Antagonism: ‘I am often inclined to go out of my way to win a point with someone
  who has opposed me’.
• Alienation: ‘ I am not likely to speak to people until they speak to me’.
• Physical aggression: ‘If somebody hits me first, I let him have it’.
• Cynicism-mistrust: ‘I know people tend to talk about me behind my back’.
• Angry reactivity: ‘When I am angry, I sometimes sulk’.
• Anger expression: ‘I have physically hurt someone in a fight’.
3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions                                           49

• Neuroticism: ‘I never do anything right’.
• Anger valuation: ‘People should never get irritated’ (Cook & Medley, 1954).
Anger is usually expressed in three different ways: as aggressive, passive or assertive
anger. Aggressive anger is the desire to hurt someone emotionally, psychologically
or physically, for example by using hurtful language, yelling, putting someone down
or physically hurting them. The aim is to protect oneself by hurting others. It is a
tactless and destructive choice experienced as a reaction to resentment, rejection or
humiliation, as a way to exert power and status or in response to irrational thoughts.
This type of reaction is usually followed by a sense of guilt.
   Passive anger can be understood as an avoidance behavior—a flight response
that bypasses direct confrontation. However, the person who experiences passive
anger may hold a grudge and later do something unacceptable to take revenge,
such as insulting those who angered them behind their backs, spreading rumours
or destroying property. Some people who experience passive anger may have poor
self-esteem and engage in self-blame. They are not only angry with the people who
‘wronged’ them, but also angry with themselves. These people are viewed as being
dishonest in their expression of anger.
   Assertive anger is a positive way of expressing anger openly and honestly, by
engaging others in communication to let them know that their actions have caused
anger and discomfort. It is expressed through language such as “I feel angry when
you…”. People who express assertive anger are more likely to be confident, self-
respecting and goal-oriented. It is a positive way to express anger, and one that takes
some time to learn and practise.
   Anger may be seen as a negative emotion, but it has a function. It tells us that
we are not happy or that we feel hurt, and that unless we do something to make a
change, a relationship is at risk. Workplace studies have even shown that assertive
anger expression, when handled effectively, can lead to positive outcomes such as
improvements in problematic management and staff issues, work relationships and
organisational progress (Geddes & Callister, 2007; Sloan, 2012; Stickney & Geddes,
2014).


3.4.5.1   Frustration

Frustration is an unpleasant emotion that arouses tension and may instigate defen-
sive or aggressive behaviours. The word has its roots in the Latin ‘frustra’, meaning
‘in vain’; it describes disappointment. Scholars describe frustration as a mental
state marked by feelings of disappointment, anxiety, despair, and irritability over a
decrease in the efficiency of an operation or the chance of success, and an experience
in the difficulty experienced in achieving a goal.
    Frustrations stems from the desire to meet physiological, material, or social needs,
and the need for security (Vovk et al., 2020).
    We know from different studies that even infants can feel frustration, and the inten-
sity and frequency of feelings of frustration increase in childhood and adolescence.
50                                                             3 Functions of Emotions

A three-year-old may throw a tantrum and shout “I hate this” to express frustration,
while an older child may ask endless ‘why’ questions in an attempt to understand this
uncomfortable state. As we grow into adulthood, frustration may also lead to anger,
aggression, and feelings of bitterness. Some scholars have also found that people
who are prone to frustration are usually more active and less attentive than others,
and more likely to have an insecure-avoidant attachment style. Children and adoles-
cents who are easily frustrated have been found to have more problems with social
interactions and in establishing social relationships, and appear to find relationships
stressful (Buss, 2011; Caspi et al., 2016; Laceulle et al., 2015; McCrae et al., 2005;
Putnam et al., 2001).
   Interestingly, frustration has also been observed in animals such as mice, chim-
panzees, pigs, rats and even bees (Vovk et al., 2020). Feelings of frustration can lead
to aggression in both humans and animals. Breuer and Elson (2017), for example,
explain that when someone feels disappointed at the thought of having only a slim
chance of reaching their goal, they will experience frustration, a negative affect.
Depending on the person’s emotional stability, personality traits, irritability, and
mood, they may experience an aggressive inclination. This may or may not lead
to aggressive behaviour, depending on the person’s cognitive ability and level of
behavioural control. Some young people prefer to play violent video games because
these allow them to vent their frustration- aggression drive by acting aggressively in
a virtual environment.
   When we experience frustration, there are things we can do to relieve it. We can
go for a walk in the fresh air to declutter our mind. We can learn to meditate and
calm our thoughts. We can engage in positive thinking techniques to shift our focus to
more positive matters. If you look for solutions to increase the chance of the success
you want to achieve. Learn better communication skills and emotional management
skills (Sharpe, 2020).



3.4.6 Fear and Calmness

Fear is a fundamental emotion that protects us from danger and harm. When we hear
a sudden overwhelming loud noise, we startle—an automatic protective response
that makes us pay attention to potential danger close by. Likewise, when we face a
perceived threat (e.g., the fear of being attacked by a wild animal), we experience
physical reactions such as sweating, increased heart rates and high adrenaline levels.
These heighten our alertness. In other words, fear prepares us to face danger, whether
physical or psychological.
   We respond to fear from infancy. For example, while a newborn is generally
happy to be passed from one person to another, at the age of 6 months or so, the
infant begins to develop memories of familiar faces, and may experience fear when
being carried by a stranger. As babies become toddlers, mobile and adventurous,
they may develop more fears, of things like heights, bugs, and animals like dogs or
3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions                                            51

cats. As they get older and become more imaginative still, they will fear monsters,
make-believe creatures and unlikely disasters.
   Scientists have identified that there are two kinds of fear: innate and learned.
The two innate fears are the fear of falling and the fear of loud noises (Garcia, 2017;
Öhman et al., 2001). Apart from these, we learn to feel fear through direct experience
of threats (e.g., touching a flame and getting burned), via verbal warnings from our
parents or social means, or by observing others. No matter how we develop them,
though, fears are a natural part of how we grow and learn about our environment.


3.4.6.1   Calmness

Calmness, or serenity, is a positive mental state that includes feelings of comfort and
security, and a lack of disturbing thoughts. It is a state of inner peace, and although it
may include happiness, some think that the two emotions are different. For example,
Bacanli (2016) describes serenity as a feeling of peace which is more closely related
to spirituality, while happiness is associated with earthly elements. Calm people are
able to maintain balance and harmony despite facing challenges and difficult times.
   People who are calm have a heightened sense of balance. They are likely to be
more stable, flexible and adaptable, and to exhibit a higher level of psychological
wellbeing. They are also more likely to be optimistic and to accept people without
judging. They tend to forgive easily and be more altruistic, volunteer their services
to others more often, show high levels of self-esteem and experience low levels
of depression, anxiety and other negative emotions. People who are calm are also
compassionate and devoted to serving others and helping strangers. They are likely
to have strong relationships and hold strong concepts of self-worth, and many have
stronger problem-solving skills and stress-coping skills, are more productive at work
and work more efficiently. Calm people who are religious may practice mindfulness
and reflection through praying, meditation and mind-calming practices, in groups
and alone (Fredrickson, 2013; Post, 2005; Von Culin et al., 2014 ; Xu et al., 2014).
   Indeed, calmness is considered a kind of spiritual intelligence. Howard Gardner
(1993) proposed that people have multiple intelligences, one of which is spiritual
intelligence. Scholars exploring this notion have identified some characteristics of
spiritual intelligence, for example, Zohar and Marshall (2000) define it as knowing
how to solve life problems by applying our thoughts to meaning-giving contexts
and assessing our actions and our life paths based on values that guide us. Emmons
(2000) contends that it helps us to develop adaptive capabilities to solve problems and
achieve goals, and Park et al. (2004) argue that people who score high on measures
of serenity also score high on spiritual intelligence.
   Researchers have found that children with calm natures were inclined to solve
problems in an assertive manner and would seldom resort to aggressive behaviour.
Interventions have been carried out in different parts of the world to promote positive
social-emotional development amongst emotionally unstable children and adoles-
cents with inadequate skills to cope with stress and curb impulsivity and aggressive
behaviour. When they were taught to engage in calming strategies such as relaxing
52                                                               3 Functions of Emotions

via deep breathing, engaging in meditation to calm the mind and muscle relaxation,
as well as social communication skills and interpersonal skills to help them solve
problems, their aggressive behaviours significantly reduced (Nickel et al., 2005).
   Calmness is a jewel in our lives. To become calm, we need to learn to be still and
pay attention to what is important in our lives. What makes us happy? What gives
us peace? Are we working hard to achieve hedonism and eudemonism? Both are
important. It is all a matter of balance.



3.4.7 Love and Empathy

For decades, social scientists have argued about whether love is an emotion. Though
many believe that it is, others argue that it is more than an emotion, because
unlike other emotions, love is long-lasting. It is physiological, psychological and
behavioural. Some describe it as a drive to feed our unconscious needs and others
as a disposition, something innate. Some describe it as an affective attitude. But to
date, there has been no consensus on its definition. In the literature, love is generally
described as a set of emotions characterised by passion, intimacy and commitment.
It involves attraction, affection, closeness, care, protection and trust. It also arouses
other emotions such as jealousy, despair, anger, anxiety, ecstasy and compassion.
It can send us flying like a kite, our moods swinging up with varying intensities
of happiness, excitement, euphoria and hope and down again with disappointment,
wariness, stress, anger, irritation and apprehension (Ekman & Cordaro, 2011).
    There are many forms of love. The first and most important is parental love,
the essence of personal development. As infants, we form bonds with our parents
and caregivers. Through the emotional exchange of verbal and nonverbal interac-
tions such as cuddling, hugging and caressing, we form attachment bonds. Secure
attachment bonds help children to develop self- awareness, trust and the sense of
safety and security that enables them to explore their environment, learn and develop
socially and psychologically. If this secure attachment bond is absent, however, it will
inhibit the child from developing emotionally, mentally and even physically, leading
to difficulties in learning and forming relationships during childhood and perhaps
also later on in life: longitudinal studies have proven that children who have suffered
neglect and been deprived of love show reduced growth in both the left hemisphere
of the brain, which increases the risk of depression, and the hippocampus, which can
hamper memory and learning (Ainsworth et al., 1974).
    Family love is an extension of parental love. Within a family unit, with parents and
siblings, love means sharing and caring. Living together means that family members
need to learn how to share, to accommodate each other’s needs, to tolerate each
other’s flaws and different temperaments, to forgive each other’s wrongdoings and to
love each other as they are. In many cultures, the extended family is also an important
part of one’s life—for example, Asian and Latino extended families form nurturing,
loving and supportive networks to look after each other’s physical, emotional, social
and even financial wellbeing. Ideally, family love is characterised by deep affection,
3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions                                          53

loyalty, respect, care and healthy attachment bonds. Healthy family relationships are
like water and air. They are vital for our survival.
    Friendship is also a kind of love. We form relationships and develop bonds with
people we are fond of, and these can turn into lifelong relationships. Friendships are
usually formed based on chance and physical proximity: many of us develop friend-
ships with our neighbours, schoolmates and workmates because frequent contact
allows us to discover more about them, and when we ‘hit it off’ with them, it takes
us another level up to become friends. The love shared by friends is known as a
platonic love. It involves two people caring for each other and sharing similar inter-
ests, values and worldviews, admiring each other, supporting each other’s successes
and celebrating their happiness, but does not involve romance or sexual desire. As
Aristotle said, a friend is a second self, and a close friendship makes us more fully
conscious of our own existence (Cocking & Kennett, 1998).
    Bartels and Zeki (2000) state that romantic love is a combination of cognitive,
emotional, sexual and behavioural phenomena. It is not an emotion but a sentiment.
They also describe it as a combination of lust and attachment, involving an intense
attraction and the idealisation of the beloved within an erotic context. This kind of
love can also be influenced by proximity: when we have regular contact with someone
via work or other social activities, we can develop a fondness for that person that
eventually sparks romance and love. However, Caston (2006) claims that when we
fall too deeply in love, we lose our sensibility and become trapped in our fantasy of
the other person, and can fall into a kind of ‘love-sickness’. This is infatuation, not
love, and it can make us form idealised views of another person even when there are
warning signs that the relationship may be harmful. In toxic relationships, people
stay together despite the fact that they are hurting each other because they are afraid
to burst the fantasy bubble and face a painful reality. Caston (2006) therefore argues
that we must determine whether it is love or infatuation that we are feeling. Doing this
takes self-awareness, understanding of the other person, time, and the willingness to
be objective.
    Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist, argues that romantic love is an instinc-
tive drive—a mating drive—and not necessarily a sexual one (2004). Based on studies
in which she scanned the brain activities of people in love, she explains that when
we are in love the brain produces large amounts of dopamine, a natural stimulant
that makes us feel happy: in other words, love gets us high. Dopamine is found in
the areas of the brain associated with motivation, focus and craving, and people who
are naturally curious, creative, spontaneous, energetic tend to be high on dopamine
in general. These people are more likely to fall in love with those who are like them.
Similarly, people who are naturally high in serotonin production, who tend to follow
tradition, also choose love partners who share similar personal characteristics. In
contrast, though, people with high levels of testosterone, who are analytical, direct,
tough-minded and decisive, tend to choose love partners who are opposite. The same
goes for people who have high levels of estrogen—those who are imaginative, intu-
itive and apt in communication and people skills, also choose to love those who are
opposite to their characteristics.
54                                                              3 Functions of Emotions

   Finally, there is self-love, which Aristotle defined as another important kind of
love. He taught that we must understand ourselves in order to view our lives and how
to live them objectively. Today, social scientists promote self-compassion—being
kind to ourselves and staying free of meticulousness—as a way to support mental
health. The ability to be compassionate to ourselves will help us to build resilience in
the face of adversity, from relationship breakups to losses, disappointments and what-
ever curve balls life throws us. Neff and Germer (2017b) describe self-compassion
as the ability to understand ourselves and forgive our own flaws and wrongdoings,
know our place within humanity, and be mindful of our emotions and how to handle
and manage them. Self-awareness, in other words, is an integral part of EI. It is vital
knowledge we need to teach ourselves and our children if we want to make a better
world.


3.4.7.1   Empathy

Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes and understand what
they are feeling. It is considered an emotional reaction rather than an emotion itself.
Hoffman (2000) describes it as the cognitive ability to understand others and see
their perspectives, and to react affectively in response to their needs. He believes
that empathy is closely related to morality and altruism. Myers and Hodges (2009)
describe empathy as the ability to feel the same emotion as another person and show
compassion to others, and the ability to refer to one’s own plight or misfortunes in
response to perceiving other people’s distress.
   Nancy Eisenberg, an American professor of psychology, studied empathy in chil-
dren to find out what kind of parenting practices foster the development of empathy
and prosocial behaviours such as caring and sharing, self-regulation and perspective-
taking. She asserts that childhood empathy is influenced by four factors: biology,
culture, personal characteristics and situational determinants. The media, parents and
peers also play a major part in shaping the development of empathy and prosocial
behaviours in children.
   Through the developmental stages of childhood, empathy emerges in three
ways: neurologically (affective arousal), cognitively (emotional understanding) and
behaviourally (emotional regulation). A study conducted by Decety (2010) on child-
hood empathy showed that some children have naturally high empathy responses to
others, reporting that children as young as one year old are able to make attempts
to comfort people in distress, and engage in spontaneous helping behaviours from
the age of 14–18 months. At the age of 2–3, children develop a greater awareness
of the context of their social interactions with others. However, Eisenberg believes
that empathy can also be learned both as an interpersonal skill and as part of EI
development (Eisenberg, 2003).
   The literature describes empathy as a multidimensional construct, and identifies
two major types of empathy: emotional empathy and cognitive empathy. Emotional
empathy is the ability to share an emotional experience, feel concern in response to
3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions                                             55

someone’s distress and show a willingness to help. It is usually (but not necessarily)
related to someone’s own experiences.
    Studies have found that women tend to be higher in emotional empathy than men
(Neff & Germer, 2017a), and that older individuals tend to score higher on measures
of emotional empathy than younger people.
    Cognitive empathy is described as the ability to take another person’s perspective
and understand how they are feeling. The person responding does not necessarily
share the same experience, but is able to imagine what it would be like to be in the other
person’s shoes. Rogers (1957) defines cognitive empathy as including an empathic
attitude, empathic attunement, empathic communication and empathic knowledge.
It is considered an essential skills for professionals in the helping services, such as
counsellors, social workers, doctors, nurses, teachers and educators. It involves active
listening to accurately understand how a client or student feels, and is essential in
enabling a therapist to perceive the client’s needs and perspectives without judging
or imposing their own interpretations.
    Empathy comes naturally for some people, while for others it is a learned
emotional response. Either way, it allows people to build caring relationships and
supportive social connections. We can all learn to become more empathic and
compassionate in order to improve our lives and make the world a better place.



3.4.8 Jealousy and Hatred

3.4.8.1   Jealousy

Jealousy has been described as a constellation of affective, behavioural and neurolog-
ical responses to the fear of losing attention and exclusivity in a loving relationship. It
arises when we are thrown into relationship-threatening situations and overcome by
negative emotions such as fear and sadness. Lazarus (1991) explains the difference
between jealousy and envy: envy is wanting and desiring what someone else has,
while jealousy is resenting someone for threatening or taking away our source of
affection, social status or pride.
   Jealousy can arise not only in loving relationships but also in our social lives and
work relationships. Whether we want to admit it or not, we all feel a little jealous of
our friends and colleagues from time to time. This is because it is natural to compare
ourselves with others: it helps us to know we where we stand and whether we need
to adjust. Presentations of jealousy are even apparent in animals (Harris & Prouvost,
2014; Morris et al., 2008)—there are numerous video clips on YouTube showing
how dogs can be jealous of a newborn baby, another dog or a new family pet! But
like all other emotions, if we can handle it properly, it should not become a problem.
   Jealousy, like other emotions, begins in infancy. It has been observed in infants
from the age of around 9 or 10 months, but becomes more obvious at 12–18 months
when a toddler’s main caregiver directs attention to a third party (Hart, 2015). Self-
awareness develops at around the age of 10 months, and as an infant’s cognitive
56                                                               3 Functions of Emotions

capacity expands, so does its understanding of dyadic social exchange. The infant
learns to make judgements, and forms expectations about their parents and caregivers
through their daily affectionate exchanges and interactions (Lewis, 2000). The world,
in the child’s mind, is made up of ‘mummy, daddy and me’, all living happily ever
after. A strong bond and attachment is formed. When a new person comes into
the infant’s world, everything changes. The new sibling (or pet, or grandparent, or
parent’s friend) takes away attention and the child now has to play second fiddle.
    Sibling jealousy is common in every family. It can be felt by a firstborn who
feels threatened by a new sibling stealing attention and focus from their parents, or
a younger child who is threatened by the older one being better at everything they
do, from riding a bike or telling a story to helping around the house. Sibling rivalry
grows as each child competes to win attention from their parents. Skilled parenting
can turn sibling competition into healthy motivation and a drive to pursue progress
in life, whereas unskilled parenting may mean it develops into relational problems
as the children grow into adulthood (Volling et al., 2002).
    Shifting the focus to another form of jealousy, some psychologists argue that when
two people are in love, they are highly dependent on each other. Jealousy arises when
this dependency is threatened and insecurity kicks in. Tipton et al. (1978) identified
five factors leading to jealousy: the need for loyalty, the need for intimacy, self-
confidence, moodiness and envy. Other scholars have also shown that in a romantic
or marriage relationship, jealously emerges when there are signs of infidelity. Men
are more commonly threatened by sexual infidelity, while women are more likely to
be jealous if they suspect emotional infidelity and sexual infidelity. However, some
have found that deception leading to a betrayal of trust is the most damaging thing in
a relationship for both women and men (Buss, 2000; Firestone et al., 2005; Harris,
2003).
    Jealousy is also strongly associated with relational dissatisfaction. Pines (1992)
maintains that jealousy functions to make us reassess our relationships, and prompts
us not to take our loved ones for granted. Healthy jealousy can increase attention,
passion and commitment to our relationships. However, different couples react differ-
ently to jealousy. Some will respond with anger, aggressive conflict, verbal and
physical aggression, violence and even homicide (Archer & Webb, 2006; Buunk,
1997).
    Freud (1922) stated that out-of-control jealousy can become a problem. He
described pathological jealousy as delusional and abnormally intense, driven by irra-
tional beliefs, a sense of guilt and perhaps a harsh superego. Different factors driving
damaging jealousy have also been identified, including self-esteem and ego defence,
paranoid personality, obsessiveness, interpersonal sensitivity and separation-anxiety
(Clanton & Kosins, 1991; Marazziti et al., 2010; Parrott, 1991). People who suffer
from intense jealousy leading to aggression and irrational thoughts must seek help
from professionals.
    Social jealousy, in contrast, mainly stems from low self-esteem. As early as the
nineteenth century, James (1890) discovered that people compare themselves to
others in terms of ‘worthiness’ and ‘competence’. Social jealousy occurs when one’s
real self fails to match up to the ‘ideal self’ (Pope et al., 1988). When people feel less
3.4 Say Hello to Some of Your Core Emotions                                          57

‘worthy’ based on a comparison of social status or wealth, or less ‘competent’ due
to differences in work achievement, they feel jealous of their peers, and may engage
in different defensive mechanisms to cope with their jealousy, such as gossiping and
spreading rumours to tarnish the reputation of the person they are jealous of.


3.4.8.2   Hatred

Hatred is a multifaceted emotion that is nested in an assortment of other unpleasant
emotions, including anger, fear, disgust, contempt, resentment, jealousy, disappoint-
ment, and annoyance (Royzman et al., 2005). It is one of the most destructive
emotions we can experience. Scholars who have studied hatred describe it as a kind
of rage (Gaylin, 2003), a strong resentment towards someone or something, a kind
of generalised anger, a motive to devalue others) and an effort to adapt to deep shame
and fear (Rempel & Burris, 2005).
    Sternberg (2005) postulates that hatred is psychologically related to love, but
is neither the opposite of love nor its absence. He explains that hate has a complex
relationship with love, and that they both arise from the complexity of personal stories
involving the negation of intimacy, passion and/or commitment. Hatred grows from
the denial of intimacy, which leads to repulsion and aversion to others. It seeks to
distance and detach us from the objects of our repulsion. It can be individual or
cultural, racial or religious. However, it is always characterised by the devaluation
and reduction of a person, group or race. Hatred invariably shows the stamps of our
personal history—the way we were brought up, educated, and influenced by our
culture, society, and personal experiences.
    Hatred is not a primary emotion. It is a learned one, involving cognitive and
thought processes. It involves our interpretation of social justice, personal success
and achievement, fairness, approval from others, connections, and rejections. These
perceptions form part of the automatic thoughts that lie latent in our minds until
something triggers a judgement. When we face something unpleasant, it triggers
our memories, perceived experiences, beliefs, and ideas. These can lead us to use
emotional reasoning and overgeneralise based on memories of previous unpleasant
experiences: for example, a reprimand from a teacher leading a resentful student to
assume “She hates me just like all the others”, and this can lead to hatred for the
teacher.
    Some of the factors that lead to hatred include an accumulation of personal frus-
trations, poor self-esteem, emotional immaturity, impulsiveness and peer and family
influence. Hatred itself can lead to acts of violence based on a desire to hurt, to
defend or to assert power over others. Cultural hostility and prejudice are common in
multiethnic societies, and have led to hate crimes, injuries, and deaths. Some people
driven by feelings of hate commit acts of violence as a goal or in order to get rid
of the people that they hate. Unfortunately, these acts of violence are encouraged in
some countries for religious reasons.

3.5 The Functions of Emotions

There is a wealth of information on the functions of emotion available in both schol-
arly articles and theses and self-help books. The following sub-sections set out the
five basic functions of emotion discussed in this literature, and how they serve us.



3.5.1 Emotions Help Us to Learn About Our Basic Human
      Needs

We experience different emotions at different situations and at different times. Our
emotions help us to understand ourselves and our states of mind: we interpret our
feelings based on our sensory systems and sometimes physical changes as well (e.g.,
increased heart rate, blushing). Paying attention to our emotional states helps us to
recognise and acknowledge our basic physical, psychological, and social needs.
    Naturally, we tend to prefer positive emotions like happiness, serenity, content-
ment, peace, satisfaction, and joy, and try to avoid unpleasant emotions like sadness,
fear, nervousness, anxiety, and anger. However, whether pleasant or unpleasant, our
emotions are a vital part of our humanity, and to be able to experience a blend of
emotions in the palette of our lives adds colour to our existences and helps us to grow
and develop.
    Having both ups (positive emotions) and downs (negative emotions) enriches
our life experience and helps us to build resilience and become mentally stronger.
However, if negative emotions linger, they can impair our health, as unresolved
negative emotions can lead to health problems including high blood pressure and
mental breakdowns. Persistent negative emotions are there to alert us to the fact that
something needs to change in our lives, and can motivate us to make those needed
changes. For example, when we are angry all the time, we know that something is
troubling us. Anger can be caused by a wide array of triggers, from simple physical
exhaustion, to feeling violated or attacked, or experiencing a high level of stress or
anxiety. Not knowing the reasons behind a continual state of anger can lead to angry
outbursts, but today, with so much knowledge and information available to us about
how to understand our emotions, we have the ability to talk about our anger with
friends and family or trained professionals, figure out the reasons for it and address
them.
    When we develop EI through self-awareness, we become more attuned to our
emotions and able to understand why we are behaving (or reacting) in certain ways.
EI motivates us to engage with puzzling facts about ourselves, rather than suppressing
unpleasant feelings and avoiding dealing with the causes of our emotions. Tuning
into our emotions help us to realise what is important to us, what we really care about
and what we should do next.
3.5 The Functions of Emotions                                                         59

3.5.2 Emotions Motivate Action

We may not be very conscious of how our emotions drive us into action or making
certain decisions. Sometimes we surprise ourselves by making choices based on our
emotions.
    Consider Jack, who is interested in Jill from next door, but is too shy to ask her
out: one day he sees Tom the piper’s son flirting with her, and without even thinking
about it he grabs two buckets and marches up to ask Jill to go up the hill with him
to fetch a pail of water! Jack is being driven by his jealousy. An unyielding emotion
like jealousy is a powerful one that can drive action!
    Likewise, anxiety is not exactly a bad emotion. It can be a motivating factor for
some people. In a workplace example, many people, when given a tight timeline
to complete a project, feel anxious. However, some are able to convert this anxious
energy into motivation and invest it into completing the project on time, where others
might worry and head to the bar instead to escape the stress.
    Similarly, our desire for justice can send us out to march in a rally. Our compassion
can prompt us to sign up to sponsor a worthwhile charity. Our pride can set us burning
the midnight oil to achieve high scores in exams. Our love for our children can lead us
to make all sorts of sacrifices. Undoubtedly, our emotions are significant motivating
influences on our actions and decisions.



3.5.3 Emotions Help Us to Connect and Relate to Others

Gaining attention from others is a fundamental human need that we develop in
infancy. As newborns, totally dependent, we need people to love us, pay attention
to us, feed us, and change us. Attention is an important part of connecting with our
fellow humans and forming bonds. As we grow up, we learn how to gain attention in
other ways than wailing and screaming (although at times, some of us still do this!).
We also learn to use different behaviours to let people know how we feel in order to
connect with them or gain their attention.
    Our emotional expressions help us to communicate our feeling faster than words
do. We know that we do not always need to tell people how we feel: they can read
our facial expressions and know instantly whether we are happy or sad. When we
are angry, we reveal it in our tone of voice. When we are intimidated, we stand
defensively and avoid eye contact to signal that we feel threatened. And just as we
habitually express our emotions through our body language, we gain understanding
from reading other people’s body language. A gaze and a smile from someone at a
party suggests that it is safe to “Come and talk to me”, while a narrow-eyed glare
from the person standing next to them cautions, “Don’t you dare!”
    And other people’s expressions of emotion arouse emotions in us. When you
see someone with teary eyes, for example, depending on your personality and how
altruistic you are, you might approach them to offer help or comfort, or walk away
60                                                              3 Functions of Emotions

wondering what’s upsetting them. Just as our own emotions give information to
others, the emotional expressions of the people around us provide a wealth of
social information that prompts us to respond appropriately in particular situations.
Knowing how to do this allows us to build richer and more meaningful relationships
with our family, friends, workmates, and fellow citizens.
   Finally, when we share our emotions with others, it helps us to release any
unpleasant feelings we have pent up inside. It allows us to talk through our situation,
and that can help us to think more clearly. Sharing your emotions with someone you
trust also increases bonding and mutual understanding. Telling someone you are sad
can reduce that sadness, and sharing your happiness increases your joy. We all crave
closeness to other people, and the sharing of emotions helps us to strengthen that
connection.



3.5.4 Emotions Help Us to Verify How We Think About
      Ourselves

Many of us experience self-doubt from time to time. We seek validation from others to
ensure that we are accepted and recognised, and to establish our own worth. Validation
builds relationships and helps to ease upset feelings; it is like relationship glue.
Knowing that we are understood and that our emotions and thoughts are accepted by
others is powerful.
    However, in order to accept our own internal experience, thoughts, and feelings,
we also need to self-validate. Ways of doing this include encouraging ourselves to
keep trying when we face challenges, acknowledge our strengths and efforts, and
feel noticed, accepted, and appreciated by others. Sometimes we need to practice
self-validation to prioritise our needs, to treat ourselves with kindness, and to accept
our own mistakes and limitations. In contrast, many young people currently seek
social validation by making friends on social media, or posting images and messages
to seek ‘likes’. This kind of reliance of external validation can make people anxious.
Instead of having a thousand online friends, half of whom may express disapproval
and make critical comments, these young people are denying themselves the time
and opportunities to establish true friendships within a small circle of people with
similar interests and values.
    Sometimes, we can also have thoughts that surprise us or that do not reflect our
values and the things we know are true. Learning about the nature of our emotions
and understanding their functions can help us to validate our thoughts, which in turn
helps us to achieve a state of calm and manage our emotions more effectively. Having
the ability to self-validate can help us to accept ourselves, lead to the development
of a stronger self-identity, and develop better skills to manage our emotions. Self-
validation helps us to find wisdom. More about self-awareness and self-validation is
discussed in Chapter 4.
3.5 The Functions of Emotions                                                       61

3.5.5 Emotions Help Us to Gain Autonomy and Personal
      Competence

Nobody is truly lazy. Even babies exhaust themselves playing with their fingers and
chewing their toes all day! We all need to be engaged—to have something to do, to
try something new, to feel a sense of purpose. When we have one, we feel energised
and enthused. We also have an inherent need for certainty and control. Even toddlers
demonstrate their need to be in control by trying to walk on their own as soon as
they achieve that milestone first step. And before their imaginations and creativity
are stunted by the industrial values of schools and insensitive teachers, they are tiny
Pablo Picassos, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts, Lucille Balls and Coco Chanels. For
those who may not have the capability to achieve the standards and expectations set
by teachers and workplace bosses, however, the most common emotion they feel is
likely to be boredom.
    Boredom is a desire for engagement. When we are bored, we become restless,
agitated and nervous, or apathetic (Danckert, 2013). Being bored and alone also
creates a sense of emptiness and fatigue. However, boredom is not a bad emotion.
For most people, it serves as an impetus to find something interesting to do, or
someone to connect with (Bench & Lench, 2013). Sandi Mann, a senior psychology
lecturer at the University of Lancashire, wrote in her book The Science of Boredom
(2016) that occasional periods of boredom and aloneness are good for our mental
health. They give us a chance to quiet down and connect with our inner self. When
we are bored, we can soothe our minds with quiet music and learn to enjoy calmness.
We can connect with nature and enjoy the blue skies—or the rain—and green grass,
and smell the roses (but mind the thorns). In order to fill that sense of emptiness, we
can think about the value of our life, develop wisdom or perhaps engage in charity
work. When we long for something to do, our mind will become creative. This helps
us to find the marvellous amongst the mundane.
    Humans have an instinctive ability to solve problems and combat challenges.
Though it may not be obvious in everyone, we all have an urge for growth. We want
to increase our ability to understand and do things, and to be valued and recognised
for our achievement and contribution to others. This quest for a sense of significance,
independence and control shapes our self-confidence and our sense of competence,
and boosts our mental wellbeing (Steger et al., 2008). In the absence of opportunities
to fulfil our sense of purpose, our imaginations can create problems for us, leading
us to feel worthless and insignificant.



3.6 Emotion, Thought and Behaviour

Gendron et al. (2012) suggest that emotion is both biologically marked and socially
constructed. They considers primary emotions such as anger, fear, disgust, happiness,
and sadness to be associated with the biology of our brains and bodies, as illustrated
62                                                               3 Functions of Emotions

by earlier theorists (e.g. Griffiths, 1997). Changes in our physical states such as pain,
hunger, thirst, pleasure and body temperature can trigger new emotions. However,
other emotions are also primed by motivational characteristics, cognitive processing,
and intention of behaviour. People use cues from the sensory input from the body,
and from memories of experiences in the environment, to make a decision to carry
out an action. For example, on a food-shopping trip, Mary passes by a bakery and
smells an enticing aroma of pies. She salivates slightly, and her thoughts take her
back to her childhood, when her grandmother taught her how to make her favourite
leek and chicken pie. This evokes a pleasant, happy emotion in her. She decides to
buy ingredients to bake the pie for her family.
    Today, practitioners in psychology and therapy tell us that our thoughts (including
our beliefs and attitudes), our emotions (feelings and moods) and our behaviour
(actions and intentions) all act together to influence how we behave and make deci-
sions. Positive thoughts can motivate us and endow us with pleasant emotions, which
in turn guide us to take positive actions that generate further positive thoughts and
emotions. Likewise, negative thoughts can drive us into an unpleasant spiral, leading
us into a dark hole of unhealthy mental turmoil.
    Many of us experience mental distress because we ‘overthink’. It is increasingly
acknowledged in the psychology literature that when we allow ourselves to overthink
and get caught up in the process of excessive mind-wandering, it affects our cognitive
thought processes, including problem-solving, creative thinking and future planning.
Evidence shows that excessive overthinking (also called ruminating—wandering into
deep thoughts) or fixating on a single problem, can lead to mental health issues and
self-defeating behaviours. These episodes of rumination can be brought about by
traumatic experiences such as the death of a family member or an accumulation
of life problems. As a result of ‘overthinking’ or ruminating, people can become
agitated and easily angered, feel anxious, became socially withdrawn and start to
prefer social isolation, or begin to display self-harming behaviours such as drinking,
taking drugs or being aggressive to others (Andrews-Hanna, 2012).
    Imagine, for example, that Tom meets Jerry on the street and enthusiastically
walks up to greet him. Unfortunately, Jerry does not even look at Tom, and walks
hurriedly past him. Tom thinks, ‘Why is he so rude?’ He begins to overthink, feeling
hurt and rejected, and decides, ‘Jerry doesn’t like me.’ Angry, he decides to unfriend
Jerry on Facebook. This prompts more self- defeating thoughts: ‘Nobody likes me,
I’m a loser!’ The anger grows and Tom finds himself writing an angry email to Jerry.
Then, after hitting send, Tom immediately feels guilty and thinks, ‘I should not have
done that’. As he goes through this spiral of negativity, Tom becomes anxious and
socially withdrawn.
    We are not generally conscious of how our thoughts and emotions work together.
Thoughts come to us automatically, and at times we might not even be conscious of
them. These automatic thoughts can be neutral, positive or negative. When we dwell
too much on the negative ones, we can develop patterns of behaviour that impact our
work or social or relational functions, which may be a sign of mental health difficul-
ties. When we experience strong emotions, we can express them in different ways,
either helpful or harmful. Some externalise these emotions via aggressive behaviours
3.6 Emotion, Thought and Behaviour                                                    63

such as verbal and physical abuse, defiance, theft, vandalism, and other destructive
and uncooperative actions. Others internalise them and suffer insomnia, somatic
symptoms, apathy, inertia, anxiety, depression, and even self-harming behaviours.
    While writing this chapter, for example, I felt a degree of frustration as I waited
for the book contract to be offered. Though I was 80% sure it would happen, it was
the 20% uncertainty that led to this frustration. In my younger days, I would have
been touchy and reactive, and expressed my frustration with grunts, huffs, puffs and
grumbles (behaviour learned from TV), followed by binge eating and compulsive
shopping. Now that I am older, wiser and calmer, I sit in my favourite spot on my sofa,
which is heavily padded with high-resilience foam, glance at the lush hills outside
the window, sip my peppermint tea and coach myself to be patient and relax. The
binge eating still occurs from time to time, when the frustration is prolonged, but
the trick is to be mindful of what to eat and when to stop. When we have developed
levels of EI, we can choose to behave in a positive manners to soothe ourselves.
Emotions are part of our lives. Recognising and understanding them is vital for our
wellbeing. What matters is knowing how we react to our feelings and acknowledge
them as they arise. The more connected we are to our emotional responses, the easier
it is to deal with life challenges big or small. Strengthening our knowledge of and
skills in EI will help us to cope with the different demands we meet at work, at home
and in society. Building our emotional competence is a deliberate, effortful and slow
lifelong process. That is why it is essential to help our children to develop such skills
and knowledge at a young age.



3.6.1 Defence Mechanisms

We all learn to cope with unpleasant situations and emotions in different ways. One
very common way of doing so is by using defence mechanisms. These are psycho-
logical strategies we use to separate ourselves from threats or unwanted emotions.
Interestingly, we are often not even conscious that we are using them. Psychologists
consider these behaviours normal, a natural part of our psychological development
rooted in three domains: cognition, behaviour and personality (Ihilevich & Gleser,
1993). However, overuse of defence mechanisms can be harmful to our emotional
and mental health, and prevent us from facing or dealing with emotional issues that
must be addressed in a mature manner.
   A number of different defence mechanisms have been identified throughout the
years. Below are the more common ones mentioned in the literature.
1.   Denial: one of the most common defence mechanisms, which people use to
     distort reality when trying to avoid pain or hurtful truths. It is an attempt to
     screen out or ignore unacceptable realities by refusing to acknowledge them,
     and is a way to avoid the impact of a traumatic situation. For example, many
     people will refuse to acknowledge that their spouse is having an affair in order
     to maintain their marriage and family unit.
64                                                               3 Functions of Emotions

2.   Displacement: the transferral or discharge of emotional reactions from one
     object or person to another. For example, it can occur when, in a heated argument,
     someone punches the wall instead of the person they are arguing with, or when
     someone who has had a challenging day at work comes home and yells at their
     family instead.
3.   Intellectualisation: a mechanism people use to avoid pain or confrontation.
     It involves using rational explanation to remove oneself from an emotionally
     hurtful or stressful situation or event. Using this strategy can buy us the time and
     space we need to process a painful situation. An example would be a student
     blaming poor exam results on bad teaching rather than admitting their failure to
     prepare for the exam. Similarly, a person who is rejected when they ask someone
     out on a date might tell themselves, ‘I only asked out of kindness, they’re not
     even that attractive’.
4.   Minimisation: the downplaying of an event’s or emotion’s significance in order
     to deal with feelings of guilt or to avoid blame. For example, someone after
     calling another person a racial slur, them claiming that it was just a harmless
     joke, or a teacher treating school bullying incidents as ‘just pranks’.
5.   Projection: a process in which we attach blame for our unacceptable desires,
     shortcomings, and mistakes to others or to the environment. For example, instead
     of accepting that you dislike your new co-worker for trivial reasons, you choose
     to tell yourself that they dislike you instead, or you forget to pay a bill and then
     blame your spouse for not giving it to you earlier.
6.   Regression: a process of resorting to an earlier, more comfortable level of
     functioning that is characteristically less demanding and responsible, in order
     to return to a point in development when was accepted and nurturing provided
     automatically. Examples might be a grown adult throwing a temper tantrum like
     a child when they do not get their own way, or demanding that their spouse take
     care of them like a parent when they get sick.
7.   Repression: an unconscious mechanism by which unpleasant thoughts, feelings
     and desires are kept from becoming conscious—almost erased from the memory.
     This protects a person from a traumatic experience until he or she has developed
     the resources to cope. For example, a person who suffered abuse in childhood
     may have no memory of that childhood pain. However, the repressed memories
     of abuse may still affect the person, causing difficulty in forming relationships.
8.   Sublimation: a positive defence mechanism in which people choose to redirect
     inappropriate urges or strong emotions toward doing something positive, such
     as taking up kickboxing or creating art instead of lashing out at people when
     you feel angry.
Many of us resort to one or more of these defence mechanisms to cope with life’s
challenges, and none are harmful in and of themselves, or when used for short
periods. However, people who have suffer extreme emotional abuse or trauma may
develop pathological defences, which can hinder them from leading a normal, healthy
emotional life and also affect their thoughts and behaviour.
3.6 Emotion, Thought and Behaviour                                                             65

   Psychology clinician Vaillant (1994) classified pathological defence mechanism
into four levels:
• Level 1: psychotic defences, commonly found in people, especially children, who
  suffer from PTSD. These include delusional projection, psychotic distortion, and
  psychotic denial.
• Level 2: immature defences, which include passive aggression (hurting oneself),
  dissociation (the development of multiple personalities) and autistic fantasy
  (retreating to a fantasy world). These defence mechanisms are commonly found
  in adolescents, substance abusers and people with brain injury.
• Level 3: intermediate neurotic defences, which include displacement (kicking the
  dog instead of the oppressor), isolation and repression. They can also manifest as
  phobias, somatisation and amnesia.
• Level 4: mature defences, which are more positive ways of dealing with emotional
  pain or stress and include engaging in sports to channel anger and aggression,
  meditation to learn to calm, humour or suppression. However, there are also
  negative acts at this level of defence mechanism, such as shoplifting or stealing
  to revenge unfair treatment, or using a position of power to control others.


3.7 Conclusion

Our emotions are an integral part of our lives. They inform us of our physical,
psychological, and social needs. These needs include our needs for safety and security
(physical and psychological), our need for purpose, goals and meaning, for intimacy,
for control, our need for attention and affection, our need for challenge and creativity,
for status and acceptance, and most important of all, our need for our connections
with ourselves. When we are emotionally ill at ease, we can ask ourselves whether
some of our needs are not being fulfilled, and act to improve our situations if they
are not. And in understanding how our emotions function to serve us, we can come
to understand not only our own behaviours, but also the behaviour of others. I hope
this chapter has been able to open some windows onto self-awareness for readers
seeking to develop self-growth by making closer connections with their emotions,
and to help them use this knowledge to develop better relationships with others.

How to Boost Your Emotional
Intelligence




4.1 Introduction

Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognise and identify our emotions and
understand other people’s feelings, motives and behaviour so that we can be more
helpful, build supportive and amicable relationships, reduce stress, minimise conflict
and increase our life satisfaction and everyone else’s. This chapter discusses how we
can boost our EI by increasing our self-awareness, social awareness, and knowledge
of self-management and relationship management skills.
    Goleman (1995) identifies four domains of EI: self-awareness, self-management,
empathy and relationship management. To boost our EI, we first must take the time
to understand ourselves and to develop the personal competence to manage our rela-
tionships. The first step in doing so is developing self-awareness. When we under-
stand ourselves better, we become more attuned to our thoughts, emotional responses
and behaviours, and with this understanding, we can develop skills to manage our
emotional reactions and behaviour so that we minimise stress and conflict and live
happier, healthier lives.
    We can also build our social competence by increasing our social awareness,
and become more empathic and compassionate. By developing our other-awareness,
we can decrease our tendencies to over-react, eliminate bad habits such as blaming
others, become more positive and be ready to act in constructive and supportive ways
to improve our interpersonal relationships.



4.2 Self-Awareness

Today, we live in a world driven by greed and competition. As a result, we all
suffer from social unrest, economic crises, environmental degradation and increasing
mental and physical health issues. Some people compete to rise to the top so that
they can earn more money and status. In the process, they can become obsessed with

greed and power, and develop inflated egos, thirsting for recognition and admiration.
And while the powerful become more egotistical, insatiable and indifferent to the
condition of others, the meek toil to survive. In their pursuit of financial security
for themselves and their families, they become more anxious, stressed and unhappy.
Life pressure is making us all—powerful and otherwise—more cynical, pessimistic
and defensive.
    However, if we all make an effort to better understand ourselves and the people
around us, we can minimise the conflicts and mental struggles caused by our uncon-
scious thoughts and behaviours and improve our lives. And we can embark on this
journey of self-growth and improvement by learning to boost our EI. This journey
begins with shining a light onto your own internal world. It demands that you be
honest with yourself. As you take this courageous step, you may begin to recognise
the contradictions that exist within you and see the blind spots that stop you from
achieving your goals, establishing positive relationships and escaping the vicious
circles of past behaviours, habits and thoughts to become more self-aware and self-
compassionate.
    We all have blind spots in our thoughts, emotional responses and actions. These
may be more obvious to others than they are to us. Think of the parent who complains,
“I can’t understand why my kid is so violent. I’ve smacked him often enough to make
him stop!”, or the shop manager who grumbles, “The assistants are useless, I have
to do everything myself ”, not understanding that when they do that, they are making
their assistants ‘useless’!
    Recognising that we have these blind spots is an important first step. However,
it does not grant us immunity to their effects. We need to engage in ongoing self-
discovery and self- development to ensure that our actions reflect the discovery of
these blind spots, and address them.
    Luft and Ingham (1955) describe four areas of self-knowledge. These are:
• The open self-arena: This refers to our understanding of our attitudes, behaviours,
  emotions, skills and knowledge, which are also known to our friends, family and
  others.
• The blind self: This refers to our blind spots—information that others know about
  us but we are unaware of or refuse to acknowledge (e.g., our arrogance, our fear).
• The façade: This refers to information known to us that we hide from others (e.g.,
  someone who appears to be very loud and confident in public but is actually very
  shy).
• The unknown area: This refers to the undiscovered self—information that neither
  we nor our friends know about us.
Together, Luft and Ingham developed a model known as the Johari Window to help
us to develop self-awareness and know ourselves better. This model is widely used
in the corporate world for personal development. Identifying our own blind spots
is always a challenge, because if we knew what they were, they would hardly be
blind spots, after all! The model is therefore helpful, as it enables us to seek the
opinions of our friends, family and colleagues, and become more self-aware of both
our brilliance and our flaws.
4.2 Self-Awareness                                                                   75

4.2.1 The Internal Self

Social scientists believe that we have two selves: an internal self and an external self
(Summers, 2013). We can increase our self-awareness by examining first our internal
selves—what is inside our emotional world, our desires, our beliefs, our values, our
thoughts—and then our external selves, the parts of us that influence how we look,
how we behave, what drives and motivates us, and how we are perceived by others.
   We can begin by identifying our personal strengths and weaknesses. Seligman
(2002) believes that personal strengths are our inbuilt capacity to think and behave
in certain ways. These are guided by six virtues, identified by Western philosophers
such as Plato and Aristotle as:
1.    Wisdom, which embraces our creativity, curiosity, love of learning, open-
      mindedness and perspectives.
2.    Courage, which includes bravery, zest, authenticity and persistence.
3.    Humanity, which includes kindness, compassion, love and social intelligence.
4.    Justice, which includes our sense of fairness, sense of community, leadership
      and teamwork.
5.    Temperance, which includes modesty and humility, prudence, our ability to
      forgive and our capability to self-regulate.
6.    Transcendence, which includes our ability to appreciate beauty and excellence,
      our ability to show gratitude, our spirituality and our sense of humour.
It is a good practice to start reflecting on the virtues that you are already living in
your daily life. Identify which ones you would like to further develop, and put them
into action whenever you have a chance.
    Other scholars also stress the importance of understanding our mental and
emotional strengths (Clough et al., 2002; Schwartz & Sharpe, 2006), which include
things like adaptability, endurance, commitment, determination and dependability.
They claim that when we do not recognise our mental strengths, or fail to align
with them, they can become weaknesses. For example, adaptability can become
inconsistency or indecisiveness, endurance can become victimhood and blaming,
and determination can become inflexibility.
    As with any strengths, overuse may also turn them into weaknesses. Mental and
emotional strengths can include our ability to:
•    honour our feelings and listen to them.
•    own our gifts and talent and nurture them.
•    ask for support when in need.
•    speak the truth without worries.
•    speak well of others and forgive easily.
•    have a direction and know what we want in our lives.
•    be respectful of ourselves and others.
•    speak well of ourselves without being boastful or egotistic.
•    surround ourselves with positive and supportive people.
•    nourish our body, feed our mind and maintain good physical and mental health.
76                                          4 How to Boost Your Emotional Intelligence

     On the contrary, we become mentally and emotionally weak when we:
• consciously or unconsciously compare ourselves with others, caring only about
  results and not about other people.
• are judgemental of and annoyed by people who are different, or those who disagree
  with us.
• let others define us and are troubled by gossip and opinions.
• become compulsive in our desires and addicted to unhealthy habits such as binge
  eating, shopping or drinking.
• crave power and use it to control others in relationships and at work.
• submit to quick fixes instead of taking time to understand our issues.
• fail to recognise our authentic existence and betray our values (Spiegelman, 2018).
Becoming self-aware requires us to be truthful with ourselves and realise not only
our strengths but also our weaknesses. We need to know and appreciate our core
values, and to lift the masks that we unconsciously put on ourselves, or that were
imposed on us as children by our family, our schools, our jobs and our communities.
For example, Wegscheider (1981) has identified five roles that we take on as children
in order to meet the expectations of our families and to offset dysfunctional family
dynamics and relationships. These roles do not always match our personalities or our
own needs, but we continue to wear them as masks into adulthood to gain approval
from others.
   These masks include:
• The Hero mask: This is a mask of perfection, achievement, responsibility and
  independence. Family expectations impose these values on the Hero child, whose
  success is driven by others’ desire to be seen as ‘good’. A Hero personality can
  be successful, but at the same time, can become a workaholic and a perfectionist.
  In their journey of self-awareness, the Hero needs to take off the mask and find
  out what they genuinely like. Did they become a doctor or a lawyer to please
  their parents? What do they really like? What makes them happy? The Hero also
  needs to slow down and allow other people to help them. They can have problems
  saying no, and feel guilty when they are not able to help others or be of service.
  Consequently, they tend to get overwhelmed by things they need to take care of
  for others and have no time for themselves, leading to stress and other mental
  burdens. If you are wearing this mask, it is time for you to put it down and learn
  to nurture your own needs and develop your own interests and talents.
• The Enabler mask: The Enabler, as a child, takes on a lot of responsibilities at
  home to help out their parents. They are usually firstborn—big brother or sister—
  but not always. As they grow up, they have a tendency to take care of others and
  nurture them, and to provide for them if they can, but this is more from a sense of
  duty than a natural instinct. As a result, they tend to overburden themselves with
  unnecessary commitments. They are people-pleasers, but also want to maintain
  control over others, run everybody’s business and control their decisions. If you
  have been wearing this mask for a long time, you need to look at your own needs,
4.2 Self-Awareness                                                                 77

  nurture yourself physically and mentally, and let go of other people’s worries and
  burdens.
• The Scapegoat mask: This is a mask imposed on children when the family is
  not in harmony and needs someone to blame for it. Parents blame a child for
  their problems rather than focusing on their failure to provide security and love
  for that child. Scapegoat children often have behaviour issues, and can be angry
  or hostile and confrontational. Some may become somatically sick to escape
  negative encounters. As adults, Scapegoats have self-esteem issues and struggle
  with different aspects of their life. They need to become aware of their strengths
  and talents and develop more self- confidence. They need a lot of support to help
  them take off their masks.
• The Lost Child mask: The Lost Child is usually quiet and shy and prefers to
  stay out of the way of problems. Some may blame themselves for any family
  woes or mishaps. They seek privacy, and like to be alone. This can be an authentic
  disposition for an introverted child, but those who are wearing the Lost Child mask
  choose to be invisible to avoid getting in trouble. As a result, they do not have
  the opportunity to develop interpersonal, social and communication skills. When
  things are complex or difficult, they adopt an avoidance attitude. They deal with
  reality by removing themselves or their feelings from the situation, withdrawing
  from things that may cause them distress or challenges. As adults, they may
  struggle with relationship problems, and have difficulty facing challenging issues.
• The Mascot mask: Children unconsciously put on this mask because they want
  to make their family happy. Some may do so because they were adorable toddlers
  who were capable of entertaining others with their charm. Others may put on this
  mask at school and in public to escape from or hide painful experiences at home.
  Some may use this to vent their anger or sadness. As adults, this tendency to turn
  everything into a joke—an avoidance behavior—will prevent them from facing
  real problems and issues.
In reality, we all need to put on these masks occasionally, but we must not betray our
own authenticity and become slaves to social expectations, constantly falling in line
with other people’s demands. As part of becoming more self-aware, we may begin
to question our choices in life and think about whether these choices were reactions
to please others, or authentic actions that match our values.
   From childhood to adulthood, we experience a range of emotions—positive ones
and negative ones. With the latter, sometimes we suppress them because they are too
painful and daunting. We may avoid dealing with issues by becoming workaholics,
shopaholics or chocoholics. In worse cases, we may turn to substance abuse or engage
in destructive defence mechanisms to escape facing these hurtful issues. However,
these suppressed emotions remain stored in our subconscious as if it were the hard
drive of a computer, and when a similar situation occurs, they emerge, leading us
to think and behave in uncomfortable and sometimes inappropriate ways that hurt
ourselves or others.
   The opposite of suppression is expression. In our journey to understand our
emotional selves, we need to become aware of some of the negative emotions that
78                                            4 How to Boost Your Emotional Intelligence

may harm us. As mentioned in Chapter 2, Asian physicians believe that our body
organs responds to our emotions.
   Suppressed emotional energy that remains unprocessed is stored in our internal
organs, muscles and tissues. Unresolved emotional conflicts build up and fester,
draining our energy and leading to burnout. And because our emotional health does
affect our physical health, as scientific studies have proven, an unhealthy mental state
can also lead chronic health issues.
   The emotional injuries we all carry may be due to intense stress from home
and work demands, loss of a loved one, relationship problems such as breakups or
divorces, family breakdown, physical or psychological trauma, financial hardship,
neglect or abandonment, discrimination from others, rejection, physical or verbal
abuse in the family or workplace and negative self- talk. Many of us carry this
emotional baggage with us because we do not know how to deal with it—we were
not taught as we grow up. Worse still, we may have learned to deal with our emotional
wounds by engaging in negative behaviour, by watching others and via movies and
television shows. But these trapped emotions need to be identified, expressed and
processed. This self-expression needs to be authentic, and we must be honest to
ourselves. Sometimes, a counsellor or a therapist can help. Today, there is also mind-
fulness training to help us sit and meditate and truly connect with our emotions,
current and past, so that we can unearth our hidden emotions and deal with them.
Some other, alternative healing processes involve body- tapping and using other body
movements to release the trapped energy in our body organs (Nelson, 2019).
   Keeping a diary or journal is a good way to pursue self-discovery and get to know
your internal self better, because this is not a one-off exercise. It is a long process,
which requires persistence, bravery and honesty. A journal will help you to reflect
and keep track of how your life story unfolds, stage by stage, giving you insights as
you gradually discover yourself and create a more confident, positive and happier
self. But the journey of self-awareness can also be overwhelming for someone. If
you are not able to gain support from a trained therapist, you might be able share
this journey with a trusted friend, sibling or partner.



4.2.2 The External Self

The external self is how we see ourselves and how we think other people see us.
It includes our self-concept, self-esteem, self-confidence, self-regulation and self-
presentation.
    Our reliance on the people in our family and social environment throughout our
lives has a powerful influence on us and our cognitive development. As infants,
we learn from our behaviours and our caregivers’ responses that certain behaviours
will win us praises—“Oh, what a good baby!”—while others will lead to scoldings.
We learn how to behave by observing the people around us and engaging in social
activities with them. Sometimes we imitate them, sometimes we get motivated by
their success, and sometimes we become cautious of our actions and behaviour, so
4.2 Self-Awareness                                                                  79

we do not step out of the line of their expectations of us (Meltzoff, 1995; Sebanz
et al., 2006).
    We form our self-concept from how we see ourselves, think about ourselves and
feel about ourselves. These self-concepts can be inaccurate, for example if we have
an inclination to perceive ourselves as our imagined selves. Simultaneously, we
also form our self-concept based on information we gain by interacting with others
and from their appraisal of us. We see ourselves based on how we are treated by
other people—their acceptance, approval, comments and feedback (McLeod, 2008).
However, this may not be accurate either.
    Sometimes people judge others based on bias and prejudice. For example, in
some Western countries, people of colour and Indigenous people are seen as inferior
and are given fewer resources at school, in their local community and in social
support. Although racial discrimination has reduced somewhat compared to previous
centuries, people who live with this sort of labelling bias are still treated unfairly,
including by being rejected and disrespected. They can also internalise these social
prejudice and form low self-images.
    Oltmann (2014) tells us that we can evaluate our self-image based on the following
six dimensions:
1.    Physical dimension: how we evaluate our appearance.
2.    Psychological dimension: how we evaluate our personality.
3.    Intellectual dimension: how we evaluate our intelligence.
4.    Skills dimension: how we evaluate our social and technical skills.
5.    Moral dimension: how we evaluate our values and principles.
6.    Sexual dimension: how we feel about our roles in society’s masculine/feminine
      norms.
People with a positive self-concept and self-image are usually confident and have
high levels of self-esteem, whereas those who have a distorted sense of self, and an
unhealthy self-image are more likely to have unstable mental states. Some may feel
isolated or uninterested in others, or empty. Some may have intense mood swings that
last for days. Some may be impulsive and engage in self-destructive or dangerous
behaviours such as drug abuse and promiscuity. Some may have strong feelings
of anxiety, and feel rejected and abandoned. And some may feel hostile and have
difficulty feeling empathy for others. People with unstable or low self-esteem also
frequently resort to defensive behaviours.
   In order to boost our self-esteem, some of us also use different self-presentation
strategies. Jones and Pittman (1982) described some examples of such strategies as:
•    the use of flattery or charm to gain affection from other.
•    the use of guilt to belittle others and elevate self.
•    the use of intimidation by being aggressive to create fear and a sense of power.
•    the use of self-promotion and self-praise to gain respect and admiration.
We are social animals. Social relationships are important to us. Psychologists tell
us that we have three basic social needs: the need for affection, the need for
behavioural confirmation, and the need for status. The need for affection refers to
80                                            4 How to Boost Your Emotional Intelligence

our need for love and acceptance—for people to love us and accept us for who we
are, and not for what we have or what we are able to do. The need for behavioural
confirmation refers to the need to be seen as ‘doing the right thing’—meeting expec-
tations, contributing to a common goal, being a ‘useful’ person. It also include our
ability to achieve, to influence, to show our knowledge and skills and to be a part of
a functional group (Steverink et al., 2020) The need for status refers to our desire to
attain prestige, respect and the admiration of others (Rucker et al., 2012). When any
of these needs are not adequately met, our mental state may be unbalanced, and our
external self will feel insecure.
    We therefore constantly attempt to validate our self-worth. We have a need to
be liked. This is why social platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are so
popular. Young people pose hundreds of selfies online to gain ‘likes’ every week.
The more ‘likes’ they get, the more they feel validated and believe that they have
friends, they are popular, and they are liked. Many resort to self-validation by evalu-
ating their popularity amongst their friends and people in their social circles, linking
popularity to affection. They also self-validate by comparing their achievements,
career successes, group memberships, and the praise they get from their social envi-
ronment with those of their friends to satisfy their need for behavioural confirmation,
and their possessions and assets, the cars they drive and the clothing they wear to
substantiate their need for status. The internet is full of articles encouraging us to
engage in social validation to increase our presence in business, to be more visible
so as to gain work opportunities. This is necessary to a degree, but overdoing it
can become an obsession and lead to peer competition, resulting in disappointment,
anxiety and a loss of authenticity.
    Self-validation is a healthy process. Becoming self-aware includes self-validation.
Know your strengths, identify your weaknesses and address your needs. Develop
a growth mindset and become unstuck from your past experiences, thoughts and
behaviours so that you can self- improve. Inspire yourself by connecting with positive
people and read books about how to nurture your emotional health (or watch YouTube
clips from reliable sources if you prefer visual media!), join supportive groups or
attend mindfulness activities. There are all sorts of ways to self-validate.



4.3 Other-Awareness

Other-awareness is the ability to think from another’s point of view and empathise
with their needs and emotions in the context of a given situation. It includes under-
standing the needs of family members, friends, workmates and schoolmates, and the
needs of members of the broader community. Though the terms ‘other-awareness’
and ‘social awareness’ are used interchangeably in the literature, some may interpret
the latter as having a broader scope which includes our ability to understand and
respond to social cues during interpersonal interactions in different situations, and
social expectations in general.
4.3 Other-Awareness                                                                   81

    Our understanding of ‘others’ and social relationships stems from our childhood.
Social learning literature shows that our siblings have a strong impact on our develop-
ment of other- awareness and social awareness. Studies show that sibling interactions
promote the development of social-cognitive insights in young children. Two-year-
olds with older siblings demonstrate higher levels of reciprocal play and language
usage than those without siblings, for example, and some of them also seem to react
less strongly to the sharing of toys, while some without siblings showed strong reac-
tions when their toys were taken by another child. Three-year-olds with siblings were
able to take their siblings’ perspectives, and show empathy and some understanding
when conflict arose (De Rosnay & Hughes, 2010).
    Birth order also affects the pace and level at which we develop self-awareness
and other- awareness. Having more siblings means a child has more opportunities to
interact socially, and increases their opportunity to learn from sharing, cooperating,
negotiating, and managing conflicts (by positive means or otherwise). A younger
child learns to mimic their siblings’ behaviour without explicit instruction. A family
with more than one child provides a social context for a child to not only learn how
to interact socially with others, but also observe how others behave, widening their
perspective on social understanding (Shneidman & Woodward, 2015; Weisleder &
Fernald, 2013). However, negative sibling interactions such as jealousy that manifests
in bullying, aggression and hostility may have an undesirable effect on a child’s self-
concept.
    As children begin their schooling, they develop social skills and social compe-
tence. How they do so, however, depends greatly on their parents and early education
teachers. At the preschool and kindergarten stage, children rely on their parents and
teachers as their principal socialising agents, although sometimes an older sibling
may be a more effective role model, provided they demonstrate appropriate social
behaviour. The child’s personality and disposition also play a vital role in early social
interactions, and will have a lasting impact that extends into adulthood. An intro-
verted child may appear shy and reluctant to initiate an interaction, while a more
extroverted or socially confident child will happily invite others to join them. And
children also grow and change their understanding of social exchanges and social
rules. While some will naturally adjust to fit in, others may need support to adapt to
different social situations.
    Peer acceptance is important in our childhood development. Children who experi-
ence high levels of peer rejection may develop low self-esteem, leading to defensive
behaviours such as withdrawal or aggression. Studies of social maladjustment in
children and youths tells us that children who feel that they do not belong or who are
constantly rejected have a high tendency to become aggressive, leading to antisocial
behaviours and even crime (Hartup, 1999; Vannatta et al., 2009).
    But where peer acceptance is important, friendship is vital. Children may be
rejected by certain groups, but if they have even one good friend, that sense of rejec-
tion is eased. Friendship offers children a sense of closeness, the opportunity to share
feelings, the experience of building trust, happiness and a positive outlook. The more
friends a child has, the easier it is for them to develop social skills, communication
skills and social competence, but quality beats quantity. The bond of just two friends
82                                            4 How to Boost Your Emotional Intelligence

can ignite powerful action and achievement, and these close connections can last for
a lifetime (Ostberg, 2003; Sullivan, 1953).
    Many children are too young to understand the complexity of group dynamics.
When rejected by a group, they tend to assume that it happened because they were not
good enough for it. Even as adults, we do not always understand the nature and the
dynamics of friendship groups! Most groups are formed based on shared interests or
already established relationships, e.g., neighbours, cousins, friends of parents. Many
of these groups also have dominant members who assume the role of group leader/s.
The acceptance or rejection of new members usually depends on the decisions of
these leaders. Children who are seen as ‘different’ are prone to face social exclusion
at school. These include those who have learning difficulties or disability, who come
from different races, who look different or who speak and communicate differently.
If children are able to understand these hidden rules and group behaviours, they will
not see themselves as inadequate or not good enough. This is why schools need
to actively teach children about friendship skills, kindness and empathy for other
people.
    As we move from childhood to adulthood, some of us become socially mature and
able to navigate through different social situations and contexts, while others remain
socially awkward and may be told they lack social skills and social competence as a
consequence. For example, people who are naturally introverted usually prefer and
enjoy spending time alone, or just with one or two friends. They are generally aware
of their internal needs and enjoy quietness and solitude. They work better on their
own and enjoy coming up with their own ideas and solutions. However, in modern
societies this may be seen as having social anxiety, being too shy or having a social
skills deficit. In order to meet social demands, many introverted individuals learn
to adapt by acquiring a range of social and communication skills to override their
natural preferences. For them, making small talks and having to listen to loud and
zealous ‘extroverted’ individuals talk about their achievements, ideas and opinions,
is tiring because these social behaviours are not their nature. Though the truth is that
some of these overzealous extroverts may be introverts in disguise, over-displaying
their ‘social competence’ to cope! Social awareness is the ability to be sensitive to
how people choose to behave in company with others and not judge them for it or
gossip about them.
    Communication is an integral part of interpersonal relationship and social
bonding. It is how we share our thoughts, feelings and ideas with others. Communi-
cation is a dynamic process, which involves verbal communication, body language
and nonverbal communication such as art and music and writing. How effective
our communication is can be affected by different variables: how the message is
sent, how it is received, contextual factors and feedback. The sender’s tone of voice
carries information about their emotions (loud and angry, soft and intimidated) and
their choice of words will indicate the person’s intent (e.g., to insult with sarcasm,
to praise with hyperbole). However, the receiver may not always realise the sender’s
intention, be it positive or negative. We are often distracted by our image or miscon-
ception of a person, and this can lead to miscommunication. Therefore, it is important
to be clear and precise with our communication.
4.3 Other-Awareness                                                                   83

    We teach others how to treat us through our communication. When someone
spends a lot of time criticising others, people are likely to avoid them. If they
are rude to others, people will exclude them from social interactions. If they let
people talk over them, some might decide they are weak and lose respect for them.
Learning to communicate effectively is an art. It takes time, practice, patience and an
understanding of social rules and interpretation of unspoken indicators and signals.
    Understanding cultural differences in how we communicate also helps us increase
our social awareness. A Japanese friend once told me that in Japanese culture, when
one person raises their voice, the other is expected to lower theirs to de-escalate
the situation and show respect to the first person, and to counter the negative energy.
Likewise, in Chinese culture, younger people are taught never to contradict the nega-
tive behaviour of an older person: even if the older person is in the wrong, the younger
person is expected to hold their tongue so as to save the older person’s face.
    Similarly, Christian children are taught to ‘turn the other cheek’ in conflict situ-
ations, and de- escalate to promote peace. Good or bad, this kind of behaviour is
rare now as Asian youths are less exposed to peaceful and humble behaviour, and
instead learn aggression from television and violent movies, and resort to swearing,
screaming and punching to vent their anger.
    Despite differences in personality and upbringing, it is still important for everyone
to develop appropriate social skills because they are fundamental to our ability to
build relationships and connections with our loved ones, our neighbours, our friends
and the people we work with.
    People with strong social skills are able to make friends easily and work well
with others because they are able to show empathy and have the skills they need to
support others in need. They are able to put people at ease so that they feel supported,
and establish trust. Having good social skills allows us to express our emotions in
appropriate ways, reduce miscommunication and minimise conflicts. People with
good social skills are liked and trusted and people are comfortable around them.
    Children can learn social skills such as showing respect for others, being polite,
sharing, being kind and helping others, developing good communication skills like
turn-taking, respecting personal space, including others during play, following rules.
They need to be shown and taught how to ask for help, to ask for permission, to be
fair, to know how to behave when winning or losing a game, to learn to apologise
when needed, and how to problem-solve.
    As we grow into adulthood, we develop additional interpersonal skills, including
active listening, a range of communication skills, showing empathy and taking others’
perspective, being kind to others, negotiating, complimenting others, being cooper-
ative, sharing ideas, resisting peer pressure, being flexible and adaptable, accepting
difference, appreciating diversity, following social rules, obeying the law, being a
good team member and developing leadership skills in ourselves and in others…this
list is non-exhaustive—it takes a lifetime to refine our social skills!—but the point
is that having good social skills will improve the quality of our relationships and
increase the joy in our lives.
    As we develop our social awareness, we will understand ourselves better, iden-
tify our social discomfort and learn how to calm our emotions when we are placed
84                                           4 How to Boost Your Emotional Intelligence

under social pressure or find ourselves in social situations that cause us stress. We
will discover our strengths and develop our social competence and further develop
ourselves to become more socially confident and more proactive in our social contri-
butions, in helping and supporting others, in making career choices and advancement
and in being happier overall.



4.4 How to Increase Our Self-Awareness
    and Other-Awareness

Awareness can be both challenging and liberating. It can take time and a lot of
self-convincing to make us see ourselves for who we really are, and to accept that
sometimes our attitudes and behaviours do not serve us and those around us well.
Realising that we might be the cause of troubled relationships is painful. It can be
easier to just ignore our flaws and continue with our avoidance of change—at least
until we meet a significant crisis. Awareness is a prompt for action; whether we want
to change ourselves is a different matter. When we are bold enough to face reality
and reflect on the cause-and-effect patterns stemming from our unconscious thoughts
and behaviour that create repetitive negative situations in our lives, we will usually
come to a decision to change. Or we can take a proactive stance and shape a better
future by making the necessary changes now.
   Positive thoughts and proactive self-talk are helpful in supporting a determination
to change. We can allow our positive beliefs to guide us—the belief that we are
responsible for the results of our actions and our behaviours, that our self-worth is
not dependent on what others think, that we can do more to help others and to be
kind and compassionate, and to serve our community and the world.
   If we are emotionally disturbed for a long time, we may need to seek professional
help. Unfortunately, not all of us can afford to see a therapist or psychologist. In
many countries, however, there are community groups that can help people in need
of social support and people who are experiencing problems such as cancer, domestic
abuse, parenting difficulties or marital difficulties. If you do not know where to get
help, maybe a friend will. The key is to ask: to reach out and seek help. But many
of us are too busy chasing our dreams, chasing security, chasing approval, chasing
vanity, chasing love, chasing wealth and hedonistic pleasure. As a result, we become
burnt out, stressed and sick, with detrimental long-term effects on our physical and
mental health. Yes, life is tough. Life is demanding. However, if we end up dead
or debilitated by illness, all the chasing is in vain. We must take time to nurture
ourselves, our emotions and our health.
   Mindfulness practice is a movement aimed at helping people to relax, calm their
minds and free themselves from stress and anxiety. Mindfulness in general means
paying attention to whatever you need to pay attention to, but in terms of wellness, it
means paying attention to your emotional and physical health. There are many ways
to practice mindfulness. Apart from engaging in meditation, you could simply just
4.4 How to Increase Our Self-Awareness and Other-Awareness                         85

sit quietly in the garden with a cup of tea and clear your mind of any thoughts. You
could choose to go for a walk by the seaside or in a quiet park, listen to soothing
music, doodle or colour pictures, practise yoga or Tai chi, knit or do needlework,
pray, cook or bake for pleasure…the idea is to free your mind from worries and feel
your existence in the moment. If you can’t do it regularly, at least set aside an hour
per week to experience the joy of quietness and tranquillity. When you have tried it
a few times, you will see the calming effect it has on you.



4.5 Self-Management and Relationship Management

As mentioned earlier, EI comprises self-awareness, other-awareness, self-
management and relationship management. Guided by our knowledge of ourselves,
our strengths and weakness, our social competencies and social discomforts, we
can take action to better manage our emotions and build more helpful and healthy
relationships.
   Self-management refers to our ability to manage our emotions—how we control
our impulsive emotional responses and behaviour in response to challenging situa-
tions. It involves the skills of remaining in control and staying calm and composed
(Gross, 1998). People with poor emotional regulation may have heightened emotional
sensitivity and react to even mild stressful events with exaggerated emotional
responses and behaviours, from blaming and accusing others to crying or throwing
tantrums. This tends to escalate conflicts instead of resolving them (Carpenter &
Trull, 2013).
   The literature featuring emotional regulation strategies highlights a few common
strategies that we can learn to cope with emotional challenges. These strategies can
help us to identify and describe how we feel when we are emotionally charged. They
can also help us to acknowledge and accept these emotions, and to manage them
instead of avoiding or suppressing them. They can help us to increase our ability to
match our emotional information with our needs and use the information to make
decisions that meet contextual demands and manage relationships. Some of these
strategies can be self-learned, though it takes time to practice them. Some will need
to be introduced by a trained therapist who will help you work through problems and
develop the insight, knowledge, skills and willingness to change. These strategies
include: attentional control, cognitive reappraisal, emotional distancing and self-
soothing.

Attention control is a common strategy used to help people with anxiety by letting
them choose what they pay attention to and ignore unwanted thoughts. People with
pathological anxiety disorder can be overwhelmed with negative thoughts and memo-
ries of bad experiences. If they dwell on these thoughts, their thinking becomes
distorted, and they lose sight of positive things around them. Unnecessary thoughts
86                                                     4 How to Boost Your Emotional Intelligence

and false assumptions about themselves and others impair their ability to make deci-
sions or even just to work and live. Some may find it hard to behave normally in the
company of people that they perceive to be against them or trying to harm them.
    Attention control involves diverting one’s attention away from negative emotions
and learning to look at positive ones instead. When someone feels an intrusive thought
is taking over, they can divert their attention to something else. This might be going
for a walk, listening to calming music or looking at pictures from a happy time. You
can create a happy diary or scrapbook to direct your attention to positive thoughts.
When you are about to take an exam or give a speech, close your eyes and visualise
how successful you are, how confident you feel and how your face will light up when
people clap for you. These visualisation strategies are common amongst successful
sportspeople.
Cognitive reappraisal is a strategy that lets people reframe their thinking so that
they understand the reality of their circumstances. Many of us have stumbled and
fallen at times in our life journey. We have many emotional scars, and some of them
still hurt. Unfortunately, if we hang onto a negative view of the world based on
these scars, including a negative view of ourselves and the future, we will suffer
further emotional turmoil. Cognitive reappraisal helps us to make sense of what we
are going through and see the positive side of life lessons instead of dwelling on
the negatives. Albert Ellis (2000) presented an ABC model to help us reframe our
thoughts to accept reality as it is and not crawl into a black hole of negativity. Step
A is to accurately describe the event, Step B is to describe your own belief, and Step
C is to think about the consequences: how you respond to the event, your immediate
thoughts, the accuracy of these thoughts, your emotional response and automatic
reaction to this event. For example, a mother shocked by unexpected news from her
son might break down her thoughts in this way:
     A: My son Jack came home today and told me that he is gay, and he is going to marry his
     boyfriend.
     B: I am in shock and can’t help thinking that I have failed him as a mother. Maybe I did not
     love Jack enough and failed to give him enough attention. Everyone will now look at the
     family with disrespect and discriminate against us.
     C: I feel very distress, guilt-ridden, ashamed and worried. I cannot stop crying. I do not want
     to see Jack because I do not know what to say or what to do. I have become very withdrawn
     and refuse to talk about the matter.

A skilled therapist would then help Mrs. Smith to go through these ABC steps again
and reframe her thoughts about same-sex attraction and love, so that she could better
understand her son and his relationship. The therapist could help her to evaluate her
beliefs about her role as a mother, and see how she could play a supportive role in her
son’s future life by accepting the fact that he is gay and embracing his sexuality and
partner. The therapist could also help her to think about the consequences of both
fighting and accepting the reality. It is not easy work to do; it would need a lot of time
for Mrs. Smith to overcome her pattern of thinking. But if she is able to reframe her
thoughts about her son’s upcoming marriage, she will be able to maintain or even
improve her relationship with her son.
4.5 Self-Management and Relationship Management                                       87

Emotional distancing is an emotional regulation technique that lets us distance
ourselves from a stressful situation by removing our emotions from it. This lets us
gain some psychological relief, so that we can clear our minds and, eventually, solve
the problem in front of us. It is difficult to think clearly in the midst of an emotional
storm, so sometimes we need to distance ourselves from a situation and find a port
of refuge where we can ease our emotional stress.
    One way of doing this is to find a calming environment and take deep breaths to
cool your emotions and return to a rational state of mind. When you are ready to
reflect on the matter that is causing distress or discomfort, you can then run through
it in your head, trying to step outside of yourself and watch your own reactions and
behaviour from a distance, as if you were a character in a film. Pay attention to the
language you used, your body language, your tone of voice, and try to recall what
was going through your head as you responded to the situation.
    Think of ways you could improve the situation if something similar happens in
the future, so that you will get less emotionally aroused and stay calm and composed,
and perhaps resolve the conflict using more positive approaches.
    Distance can refer to physical distance—that is, physically removing yourself
from the situation. It can also refer to time—giving yourself time to process what
has happened, what needs to be done, and what are the best ways to do it. It can also
means distancing yourself from the emotions that are driving your behaviour. For
example, if you find yourself engaged in a heated argument, instead of raising your
voice to make your point, you can learn to control your emotions, stop talking and
listen to the other person, to gather information about why they feel the way they
do so strongly. It takes a lot of learning and practice to do this well. School teachers
can teach their students this skill through role-playing or improvisation activities in
drama class.
    Distance can also refer to emotional distance. Emotional distancing is a neces-
sary skill for people in the caring professions, such as doctors, nurses, social workers,
counsellors, psychologists and therapists. It is also vital for law enforcement offi-
cers and judges, who cannot allow their emotions to get in the way of delivering
impartial justice. While most of these professionals are naturally compassionate
and sensitive towards other people’s needs and suffering, they cannot afford to get
emotionally involved with their patients, their clients or individuals under their care,
or they risk becoming burnt out. They can develop the skill of emotional distancing
by participating in emotional sharing groups to increasing their understanding of
interpersonal differences in how they respond to their emotions, their attachment
styles, their motives and attitudes.

Self-soothing is a strategy to help us deal with the fact that sometimes reality just
really hurts. We make mistakes, and must face consequences. Sometimes people do
cruel and hurtful things to us and there is nothing we can do to but bear the pain.
Forgiveness is one way of letting go and freeing ourselves from further hurt. We can
also take time to be kind to ourselves—treat ourselves with compassion and heal
ourselves with self-soothing strategies. Mindfulness meditation is a very good way
of letting go and healing our mental and emotional wounds. We can also engage in
88                                             4 How to Boost Your Emotional Intelligence

relaxing activities like taking a warm bath, swimming, going for long walks, listening
to soothing music and seeking support from trusted and empathic friends.
   Perhaps it would be easier to deal with our hurtful emotions if we were taught
how when we were young. This is why it is necessary to help to develop EI in our
children. We can start to foster emotional regulation in children by just being good
models for them. Teachers can teach EI through stories to help them develop social
understanding and empathy, and present simulation activities to help them discuss
coping strategies and work out how to handle challenging situations. We can help
them develop an emotional vocabulary so that they can express their feelings and
seek help, encourage children to talk about the stresses, worries and relationship
challenges they meet at school. We can teach them to respond to intense emotions
and delay action when they are feeling emotionally uncomfortable just by using a
simple strategy: Stop, breathe, think.

Relationship management is an integral EI strategy that we all need to develop.
Having the awareness, knowledge and skills to manage our relationships can free
us from a lot of the stress and suffering arising from problems in our relationships.
These skills include how to build friendship, e.g., to go from work associates to
lifelong friends, how to maintain the relationship and how to develop it to make it
more meaningful for the parties involved. On the other hand, if there are people who
make us uncomfortable and affect us in negative ways, we also need to work out why
this is so, and learn ways to either improve the relationship or tactfully avoid it, e.g.,
by seeing less of the person without being negative. And there are times when we
will need to terminate a relationship, for whatever reasons, and so we need to learn
to think about the pros and cons of doing so, identify the consequences and prepare
ourselves to face the pain we might cause ourselves and the other party. It is always
best to be able to end a relationship in an amicable way if you can, and not burden
yourself with guilt or regrets.
    The literature on relationship management focuses mainly on the commercial
side of the topic. Writers focusing on relationship management as part of EI devel-
opment have highlighted topics such as leadership and relationship management,
client and customer relationship management, and relationship management strate-
gies in organisations. These are important workplace knowledge and skills. However,
we do not only manage our relationships only at work. Knowing how to manage our
relationships in our personal lives is equally, if not more, important.
    Relationships are dynamic and change over time, and these changes are driven by
both parties involved. Each actor has their own desires and intentions regarding what
they want from a relationship and how they would like it to develop. This means that
we need to nurture our relationships, and put in effort to build, maintain and develop
them—with our parents, siblings, loved ones, friends and workmates. Without having
some level of EI, self-awareness, and other- awareness, we will make mistakes, offend
people, trigger misunderstandings and set off negative emotions in ourselves and in
others, and this will eventually lead to the deterioration of the relationship. Then both
parties suffer.
4.5 Self-Management and Relationship Management                                                  89

   But relationship management is not as easy as a six-step strategy in an article
on leadership. It involves our attitudes, how we present ourselves to others, our
strengths and shortcomings and how we communicate with others, at home and
in the workplace. We cannot manage our relationships wisely or properly without
understanding the dynamics of all our different relationships. Part II of this book will
discuss the different kinds of human relationships: parents and children, siblings,
lovers and spouses. Part III will discuss work relationships and relationships with
people in our community. Part IV will discuss in more detail how to help children
develop EI and cope with emotional challenges. I hope you will find these chapters
useful in encouraging your growth and development of a higher level of EI that
supports your knowledge and skills in relationship management.

Family Relationships and EI




5.1 Introduction

Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to truthfully perceive and appraise our
emotions and express them in effective ways so as to maintain harmonious inter-
personal relationships. The family is where we first learn about relationships. It is
where we form emotional bonds and learn about social interactions. The continuous,
evolving dynamics of family relationships require us to develop skills, knowledge,
practice and emotional intelligence to support, love and care for our family members.
Developing EI in family relationships helps us to become more aware of our own
needs, and our roles and responsibilities in providing family members with a feeling
of security, a sense of belonging and a pride in being valued, loved and respected.
    This chapter discusses research findings on the different family combinations in
our current societies, and how changes to family structure can impact children. It also
discusses family dynamics and the factors shaping family and marital satisfaction.
It aims to inspire readers to reflect on their current and needed strengths so that they
can increase their family joy and wellbeing through both self-awareness and other-
awareness within the family, and promote the development of increased EI in family
relationships.



5.2 Family Structures and Combinations

Family structure is a term used in the discipline of sociology which describes how
the members of a family are linked by marriage or marital partnership, biological
relatedness and living arrangements. The OECD (2011) tells us that one in six chil-
dren now lives in a single-parent household headed by a woman. While traditional
two-parent nuclear families are still the majority in many countries including Japan,
Korea and Greece, family structures all over the world have changed. Internationally,
almost 20% of marriages end in divorce within five years, and marital and family

breakups have resulted in the formation of many different types of family structures.
Each of these family groupings has its own characteristics and relational dynamics.
This increase in family structure diversity has changed the definition of ‘family’.



5.2.1 Types of Family Structure and Combinations

Over the last five decades, there have been significant changes to the types of family
structure seen in both Western and Eastern societies. The traditional family form is no
longer the sole type of family unit anywhere. Instead, many combinations of family
structures are accepted and supported. Current sociological literature describes six
major types of family combinations:
1.   Nuclear families: what have been considered ‘traditional’ families comprising
     two parents and their children. These children may be the biological offspring
     of the parents, or they may be adopted. According to the 2016 US Census, 69%
     of children in the US still live in nuclear families.
2.   Single-parent families: families with only one parent—a mum or a dad who is
     either divorced, widowed, or otherwise, or who has chosen to adopt a child alone
     and build a family with them. Some studies have found that children who grow
     up in single-parent families can be more independent than children of nuclear
     families, as they may need to help their parents out with household chores or
     look after younger siblings. Depending on family dynamics and circumstantial
     factors, relationships in single-parent households can be either very close, or
     problematic due to financial burdens and other pressures faced by the parent.
     However, it has also been found that children in single-parent families tend
     to have less parental regulation or emotional support, and thus have weaker
     coping strategies and be more prone to engage in substance abuse or risky sexual
     behaviours, and to have problems with interpersonal relationships (Lansford
     et al., 2006).
3.   Stepfamilies: families formed when two people remarry or live together as a
     couple. One spouse or both may have children from their previous relationships.
     The parents then become stepfather or stepmother to these children, and any
     children they have in their new marriage will become their stepbrothers or
     stepsisters. This family combination can be challenging to all members, as there
     are dynamics and demands on each member of the family that they all have to
     learn to adjust and adapt to.
4.   Grandparent families: families in which children live with their grandparents
     instead of their parents. This may be due to the loss of a parent to death or a
     relationship breakup if the other parent is not able to look after the children
     due to work or other demands. There may also be other social and personal
     causes for the formation of grandparent families. Relationships in this familial
     combination depend on the personalities of the individuals, and the health, age
5.2 Family Structures and Combinations                                                 93

     and financial status of the grandparents. This arrangement is possibly more
     preferable to having the children sent to foster care.
5.   Extended families: families where, in addition to the nuclear family unit (mum,
     dad and children), other family members live together including grandparents,
     uncles, aunts and cousins. These families usually share cultural values and
     cherish family support and respect for the family’s senior members (grandpar-
     ents, uncles and aunts). Children growing up in such household tend to learn how
     to adjust satisfactorily to different demands from their adult family members,
     and how to get along with many cousins and siblings. There are, however, issues
     regarding personal privacy, family obligations and personal freedoms in this
     family structure. Extended families are not uncommon in non-Anglo cultures.
     Many European, Middle Eastern and Asian families live in this type of family
     structure.
6.   Childless families: families formed by two people who choose to live together
     to form a relationship and simply enjoy each other’s company without having
     children. They can include couples who are not able to conceive, and those who
     choose not to. Many such families have pets instead.
As a result of issues including deaths, marital failure, divorce and remarriage, families
can go through various restructurings over time, causing instability in the lives of
their members. Some of these changes can be for the better, but experiences of family
change and instability still have a tremendous impact on children and their wellbeing
(Osborne et al., 2012; Qu & Weston, 2013).



5.2.2 Changes to Family Structure and Transition
      Adjustments

Marital separation and divorce have become common social phenomena in most
developed countries. In Australia, for example, Kaspiew (2007) reported that the
‘traditional 2-parent family’, which made up 48.4% of all families in 1976, dropped
to 37% of the total by 2006. Similarly, the percentage of single-parent families in
Australia increased from 6.5 to 10.7% over the same period. Separation and divorce
are not only stressful and difficult for the couple involved, but can also affect children
and the extended family. Studies have found that it takes a family at least two years
to regain its equilibrium after a separation or divorce, and some scholars have found
that children with divorced parents are at higher risk of problems compared to their
peers whose parents are not separated or divorced. For example, before or after a
parental separation, some children may regress in their behaviour and demeanour, be
more irritable, display depressive symptoms, engage in noncompliant behaviour and
have problems with social relationships and a decline in school performance (Amato,
2005; Kelly & Emery, 2003). Nonetheless, children appear to be more resilient than
was once thought. A majority of children who experience parental divorce adjust
well and do not exhibit enduring emotional or behavioural problems. In an American
94                                                         5 Family Relationships and EI

study, for example, Hetherington and Kelly (2003) found that 75% of children did
well after experiencing parental divorce, while only 25% experienced emotional and
behavioural problems. Data captured on children’s resilience also found that most of
the difficulties they do experience are short-term, and when given support and time
for adjustment, many children bounce back (Amato, 2005; Wallerstein & Blakeslee,
1989).
   Divorces unavoidably lead to changes in family structure and a period of adjust-
ment for both parents and children. The transition may be more difficult for some
families than others. Depending on the temperaments and adaptability of the chil-
dren and adult family members, some transitional experiences may heighten levels
of emotional and behavioural unpredictability in some children, especially less
adaptable ones (Ackerman & Brown, 2006).
   In addition to this, human relationships are complex and challenging, and finding
a suitable new partner after a divorce is not easy. Consequently, some children expe-
rience multiple family transitions throughout their childhood. This experience of
family instability is more strongly associated with compromised and adverse devel-
opment opportunities for these children (Osborne et al., 2012; Waldfogel et al., 2010).
Family structure changes means household shifts and residential moves. Most often,
due to changes in household income, middle-class families need to move to lower
quality residences. This increased family transition and instability has been found
to be a major cause of negative outcomes for children (Crowley, 2003; Ersing et al.,
2009).
   Divorce also tends to bring about a decline in financial resources for the family.
Some divorcees, particularly men, may need to pay alimony and child support in
addition to financially maintaining a new marital relationship and family. Empir-
ical evidence shows that children in low-income homes generally fare less well in
terms of cognitive, social-emotional and physical development compared to those
in households with better financial resources. Single-parent households with parents
struggling to make ends meet cannot afford to invest in the development of their
children in terms of nutritious food, cognitively stimulating toys and quality family
time to the same extent (Gennetian et al., 2010), and families facing legal problems
around child support, custody arrangements and parent access face more stress than
others, adults and children alike (Parkinson et al., 2007).
   Some studies indicate that teenagers have the hardest time adjusting to new family
arrangements. In one example, Ruschena et al. (2005) found a notable increase in
parent-teen conflict and lower quality parent-teen relationships. Some scholars have
also found that family transitions have a strong impact on high school students, being
correlated with a higher rate of school dropouts and the internalising and externalising
of emotional stress (Cavanagh & Huston, 2006; Lansford et al., 2006).
   Nevertheless, family changes and regroupings do not always bring gloom and
doom. There are many success stories and happy endings too. When a parent remar-
ries and is able to manage the change in a positive way, children show better develop-
mental outcomes as a result of settling into a new, more stable family environment,
with well-adjusted parents who are able to support their needs and help them adapt
5.2 Family Structures and Combinations                                             95

with consistent routines, love and encouragement. These success stories depend
heavily on the personal characteristic of each parent, their resources, the quality of
the care they provide and other environmental factors (Brown, 2010).



5.3 Family Dynamics

Family relationships are complex and intricate and thus cannot be understood in linear
terms. We can never explain family issues by simply stating that event ‘A’ produced
problem ‘B’. Each family is strongly bonded with complex dynamics and multiple
patterns of behaviour unique to it, and these can lead to healthy relationships or
family dysfunctions, and in most families a mixture of both. Bonds within the family
are influenced by the marital relationship of the parents, parent–child relationships,
sibling relationships, and the influence of family dynamics (Ramachandran, 2012).
    The term ‘family dynamics’ refer to the roles and relationships of family members,
their patterns of interactions, and the factors that shape their interactions. These
dynamics are influenced by the nature of the parents’ relationship, the number of
children in the family, the personalities of the family members, family values and
beliefs, the family’s cultural background and ethnicity, the nature of the attachments
in the family (e.g., marital attachment, parent–child attachment, sibling attachment),
influence from members of the extended family, and social-economic factors such as
levels of education, social status, and wealth or poverty (Jabbari & Rouster, 2021).
Family dynamics influence how young people see themselves and others, and how
they form relationships both in their childhoods and later on, in their adult lives.
All families have both helpful and unhelpful dynamics. Sometimes these can lead to
family conflicts.
    Family conflicts arise in every family from time to time. Sometimes they may be
due to differing opinions or opposing points of views, differences in values or minor
misunderstandings. At other times, there may be relationship issues between marital
couples, parent–child issues or sibling rivalries. Sometimes there may be adjustment
problems, for example when a new member joins the family—a newborn, step-parent
or stepchild. Sometimes, there may be problems encountered by children as they grow
from childhood to adolescence. Occasional conflicts are a normal part of family life,
and many of these minor conflicts can be solved if family members are able to:
•   respect the other person’s point of view.
•   keep calm and actively listen.
•   define the problem and show a willingness to work out the issue.
•   separate the problem from the person.
•   find common ground.
•   maintain clarity and stay reasonable.
•   refrain from blaming or being defensive.
•   agree to disagree if no resolution can be found.
96                                                          5 Family Relationships and EI

Sadly, some families will face multiple problems consistently. In addition to the
common conflicts that most families face, they may have more severe problems to deal
with, such as addiction issues, domestic violence and abuse issues, chronic financial
issues (e.g., poverty) or chronic health issues. These challenges produce intense
emotional stress for all members of the family, and can cause long-lasting anger,
resentment, anxiety and depression. They can also lead to family breakups, such
as divorce or marital separation, and can have adverse consequences for children’s
development, diminishing their sense of security, trust, self-esteem and self-worth.
These critical problems are too complicated for one person, or the members of one
family unit, to solve by themselves. They may need intervention from professionals
such as social workers and family therapists. In the complex world we now live
in, community support is also essential to help families in need, and more social
and community support organisations are needed everywhere. In some countries in
Europe and Asia, for example, schools, community and religious groups have set up
support groups run by trained professionals to help with family problems.



5.4 Factors Shaping Family Satisfaction

Every couple desires a joyful family life and wants to create and nurture a happy
family. To do so requires ongoing attention and effort, though, because there are
so many interacting factors in a family that can create disharmony. There may be
demanding mums and dads, cranky teens and trying toddlers making life challenging.
Yet in a close-knit family, if the family is able to create a safe and healthy environment
where everyone feels cherished and loved, these are minor issues that will be easily
overcome.
    Sociologists interested in studying family dynamics have identified a range of
factors that shape family satisfaction (Chao, 2001; Hamilton & Carr, 2016; Hunt-
ington, 2008; Johnson & Greenman, 2006; Kerr et al., 2003). They include: uncon-
ditional love and strong family bonds; personalities and personal characteristics;
interpersonal relationships within the family; financial stability; quality family time;
support in stressful situations; shared life concepts and values; realistic expectations;
compatibility; and power sharing. These factors are summarised below.



5.4.1 Unconditional Love and Strong Family Bonds

Unconditional love means love that is given or received without any strings attached.
Your loved ones are not seen as indebted to you for the love you give, nor do they
need to do anything to earn it. Many of us grow up in families that do not understand
what unconditional love means. For example, parents may unconsciously make their
children earn their love by showing favouritism towards siblings who do well at school
or excel in sports. Some parents punish their children when they get in trouble at
5.4 Factors Shaping Family Satisfaction                                            97

school, or ignore them for days, instead of trying to understand the challenges they
face. Some may kick their teens out of the family home if they develop a drug
addiction instead of helping them. Similarly, in a marriage, one spouse may use sex
as a means to get what they want and withhold affection and sex until they get their
desires.
   Unconditional love does not mean love without boundaries. This can lead to
abuses of power and the development of unhealthy relationships. Consider Maggie,
who loves her husband deeply. He is an alcoholic who constantly loses jobs because
his heavy drinking leads to ill health. For Maggie, unconditional love means looking
after him when he is sick, working three jobs to make ends meet, and not complaining
when he ‘enjoys his drinking’. Because she gives him unconditional love, she believes
that she is being kind and saintly. However, not knowing how to set healthy emotional
and relationship boundaries, she lives in an unbalanced relationship of give and give
and give some more, neglecting her own needs.
   We all have different personalities, habits, and flaws. Unconditional love is about
accepting, connecting, caring and supporting. When a family member is on a path
that may lead to unhealthy or harmful choices and behaviour, unconditional love
also means letting them know that they need to make changes, and giving them the
support, they need. It is easier said than done, but take Maggie’s case as an example:
she could tell her husband, ‘I love you dearly and I want you to know that you
need to stop your indulgence and excessive drinking. I can no longer support this
family financially when you keep losing your job over your heavy drinking, and I
am concerned about your health and our relationship’.
   When a family member is ‘in trouble’ or doing the ‘wrong’ thing, instead of
judging and criticising, family members can show them love, advocate for them, and
support them in making changes and overcoming their challenges. This may be easier
for individuals with a high level of EI and exceptional personal characteristics to do
than it is for the rest of us. However, this deep connection of kindness, acceptance
and love will form a strong family bond.



5.4.2 Personality and Personal Characteristics

Personality encompasses our inborn traits and the development of the cognitive and
behavioural patterns that influence how we think and act. Character is an aspect of
our personality, and is influenced by our families and the experiences we have outside
the family. We are all different in our personalities and personal characters. Young
parents often feel astonished by how different their children are even though they
live under the same roof. One child may be quiet and placid and another may be
flamboyant and passionate. Even twins have different personalities and characters.
   Sometimes differences in personality may create conflict between spouses,
siblings or parents and children. Awareness of the needs, preferences and behaviours
of your family members is therefore a vital factor in creating strong bonds. Knowing
how to appreciate the strengths of each personality and learning to accept and adjust
98                                                       5 Family Relationships and EI

to personality differences can help to minimise family conflicts that arise due to
personality clashes. Find ways to connect to one another that support their needs
and wants. Understanding and accepting personality differences will help to build
stronger family cohesion.



5.4.3 Interpersonal Relationships Within the Family

We are taught both at school and at work about the importance of developing good
interpersonal relationships. However, this important social skill actually needs to
be taught at home, with parents as models. Interpersonal relationships are built on
a combination of self-awareness and other-awareness. Knowing your own thoughts
and emotional needs, behaviour and communication patterns is the first step in estab-
lishing good interpersonal relationships. Communication is the next step, as conflict
usually arises as a result of miscommunication and misunderstanding. Parents must
therefore learn to provide a safe and accepting environment that allows children to
express their thoughts and needs, ask questions, state opposite views, and protest
or complain. When children are encouraged to express their emotions—positive or
negative—they will feel free to share and communicate openly with their family.



5.4.4 Financial Stability

Financial stability enables families to access safe accommodation, healthy food and
other necessities to build a healthy family. A financially stable family can focus
more resources on the development of its children. Such a family can afford to go on
holidays and create happy childhood memories, and give children more opportunities
to follow their interests and develop their potential in art, music and other areas.
Family members are also more likely to have more time and energy to take part in
charitable events and community service.
   The majority of social problems in our modern societies stem from family financial
hardship. Children living in poverty face many barriers while growing up. A lack
of money can lead to parental stress and mental health issues. Sometimes, it can be
the cause of marital and family breakups. Short-term debts can be overcome with
the aid of governmental intervention and family support, but long-term poverty will
impact family life and happiness. This is one reason why access to family planning
is so important. Nonetheless, there are always circumstances that are beyond our
control. Families facing financial problems need support. Knowing how to seek out
and accept help is one way of coping with family financial challenges.
5.4 Factors Shaping Family Satisfaction                                               99

5.4.5 Quality Family Time

Quality family time means having time together as a family to share fun and joy. It
helps family members to connect and develop closer relationships, and to know one
another better. Spending quality family time together also means having time to listen
to one another, communicate and support one another. These days, many parents are
so busy with work demands that finding family time to spend together is sometimes
challenging, but even having dinner together and talking about each other’s daily
undertakings, tasks and amusements can be quality family time. Families that spend
a lot of time together tend to be more loving and connected.



5.4.6 Support in Stressful Situations

We all feel stressed from time to time, due to pressures from our workplaces, schools,
social encounters, communities and perhaps even our governments. Many of us can
cope with short bursts of stress, but there are times when we feel overwhelmed and
experience strong negative emotions due to these demands. Different people react
differently to stress; some may become irritable and some moody, and some may
withdraw and prefer quiet time to ease the mind. Emotional support from family
members is a protective factor when it comes to dealing with these difficulties and
challenges. When we know that we are loved and that our family is always there to
help and comfort us, then life becomes easier. Without that safety net, we may feel
alone and helpless, and can develop physical and mental ailments such as dimin-
ished immunity, high blood pressure and other physical diseases, and even cognitive
decline.



5.4.7 Life Ideals and Values

Our values are the ideas and concepts that are important to us, such as love, freedom,
respect, equality, financial security, friendship, etc. Every family has a set of core
values important to its members. Some may be handed down from previous genera-
tions. These may include their cultural identity, religious beliefs, beliefs about educa-
tion, and moral values such as honesty, responsibility, family bonding, love and
respect, personal independence and social status. These values can help to define the
behaviour of the family as a unit. Family values can also serve as a compass to give
family members a clear outlook on life, helping them to develop their identities by
understanding their backgrounds and their moral bearings.
100                                                         5 Family Relationships and EI

5.4.8 Realistic Expectations

Relational expectation is the belief that our loved ones will treat us with love, honesty,
and respect. That is the most basic of expectations in a relationship: most people
would not marry if their relationships did not meet these expectations in the first place.
Our children expect us to love them and support them with our care and financial
resources. Our spouses expect us to be truthful, loving and honest with them. As
families, we expect to help and support each other and to maintain a healthy, loving
family bond.
    Aside from that, different families have different sets of expectations of their
spouses, children and other family members. Having expectations is important
because it encourages our loved ones to do better and to behave acceptably. However,
some parents may place too many expectations on their children, and create pres-
sure on them, while others may have too few expectations, leading their children to
become lazy, dependent, irresponsible and lacking in opportunity to develop their
potentials. Likewise, some children expect their parents to shower them with gifts
and toys all the time, taking for granted what their parents give them out of love and
failing to appreciate all the gifts of love they get. To be an emotionally intelligent
family, it is helpful to know what expectations our partners, our siblings and our
children have of us, and what expectations we have for each other.



5.4.9 Compatibility

Compatibility refers to the alignment of individuals’ values, lifestyle choices, educa-
tion levels, interests and family goals. People who can find a perfect match in life are
lucky, as this is very rare, but when two people in love are compatible to any degree,
they tend to feel secure and comfortable with each other. They are happy to spend
time together and equally happy to spend time apart. While every couple ‘fights’
from time to time—not physical fights, but disagreements and friction for different
reasons—when a couple is compatible, they can easily forgive each other and recon-
nect. However, when a couple is vastly incompatible in temperament, educational
levels, values and so on, there tends to be more conflict in the relationship and an
imbalance in power and relational dominance.



5.4.10 Power Sharing

Power in a relationship refers to a person’s ability to exert influence and control over
others. Power is not a dirty word. We all want power because we want to be able
to have our say in decision-making, to feel that our opinions are valued and to feel
that we can control our own lives without being controlled by others. In the past, in
5.4 Factors Shaping Family Satisfaction                                           101

many patriarchal societies, the father, as the head of the family, had ultimate power
over the family. Negotiations and compromise were sinful acts and everyone had to
‘respect his authority’! Without education, newspapers, TV and social media, wives
and children who did not realise that they had a choice obeyed this tradition for
centuries, living in fear under the control of the powerful males around them. Thank
goodness for education and equal opportunities for women! We are now blessed with
choices and equality, and no longer have to live under men’s control.
   When two people fall in love and decide to marry and build a family, one of the
most fundamental factors in them having a happy relationship is their respect for
each other. Respect means treating others the way we want to be treated, and making
each other feel valued, supported, and treated fairly and equally. Yet in many marital
relationships, one spouse is more controlling than the other. Most of them do not
realise this. One spouse may be more easygoing and happier to let the more dominant
partner make most of the decisions. But when one spouse gets obsessed with power
and becomes controlling, then a power struggle will take place.
   A power struggle occurs when two or more people are trying to gain control
over the same thing and want to have their decisions honoured. In reality, we all
want different things, some of which may matter to one person but not another. So,
what to do? Communication and understanding are required, and sometimes, family
members need to make compromises. This means that one person may have to give
something up to accommodate the needs and desires of another. A loving couple
would naturally play fair to ensure that one person does not always give up what they
want and be the one to compromise all the time, but this doesn’t always happen.
   Leadership literature teaches us to empower and not to overpower. Empowering
means supporting the people we love so that they can fulfil their needs and goals.
This is more effective than being dominant and using power to make people do things
the way you want. And the concept of empowerment is applicable to maintaining
healthy family relationships, too, as power sharing in a family means changing your
concept of power from a hierarchical model to a supportive ‘web’ model, where
everyone in the family has an equal say in decision-making and need not be tightly
controlled by the parents or older siblings.



5.5 Marriage and Family

Marriage is the physical, spiritual and emotional union of two people and the begin-
ning of a new family. People get married for many different reasons, but love is
usually the major component in their decision, and traditionally, marriage has been
considered a lifelong commitment between partners to honour, to love and to care
for each other in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer. However, human rela-
tionships are complicated, and unfortunately, due to the multiple demands we face
in life, marriages have become a more fragile form of fulfilment, and many choose
to take the easy way out and choose to live separately or get divorced instead. Life-
long commitment requires both parties to be willing to understand and accept the
102                                                        5 Family Relationships and EI

other fully—the good and the bad. When people are prepared with EI skills early
in life, they will be more self- and other-aware, more able to show empathy for and
understanding of their spouse’s needs, and more able and willing to manage their
own emotions and support their partner in weathering relational conflicts. EI is vital
to creating healthy family relationships.



5.5.1 Why Do People Get Married?

Marriage is an important part of life for many people. We shed tears of joy at weddings
and feel happy for the couple as they unite in different cultural, religious and civil
ceremonies. People marry for many different reasons that are unique to them: love,
is of course the key factor, but other reasons include companionship, demonstrating
long-term commitment to a relationship, providing security for children, gaining
legal status and financial security, to meet religious standards and avoid ‘living in
sin’, and many more.
    Being married means having more time to spend exclusively with the person you
love, doing things together, sharing hobbies and interests and solving life problems
together. Marriage enhances physical closeness, creating stronger emotional connec-
tions and increasing sexual enjoyment. When both spouses work, their joint financial
income can increase their opportunity to buy a property and build a comfortable home,
halve the expense of living alone, and in some countries, reduce the amount of tax
they have to pay. This is certainly an added bonus to all the other benefits of getting
married! Marriage can also expand our family and support networks, offering oppor-
tunities to learn more about other cultures and traditions, establish relationships with
people with different professions and areas of interests, learn life lessons from more
elders, and gain more support for childcare needs and advice on education and marital
concerns. Big family celebrations create joy and help to uphold family traditions and
cultural institutions.



5.5.2 Factors in a Healthy Marriage

Sociologists and psychologists have long been keen to learn about marital satisfaction
and factors that promote a healthy marriage. One example is from VanLaningham
et al. (2001), who found the following were factors that led to a healthy marriage
and marital satisfaction:
•   love and commitment
•   sexual intimacy
•   time for each other
•   honesty and trust
•   generosity and kindness
5.5 Marriage and Family                                                                 103

• respect and humility
• patience and forgiveness
• communication
VanLaningham et al. (2001) found that newlyweds enjoy high levels of marital satis-
faction. First of all, they are deeply in love and create romantic moments for each
other. Being in love makes us feel motivated and inspired; it makes us bring the best
sides of ourselves to the relationship, serve our partner, please them and overlook and
accommodate flaws and weaknesses. Newlyweds are both building a dream based
on their hopes, plans and mutual support. Sadly, however, in some relationships, the
strong bond may decline after as little as two years of living together. Doss et al.
(2009) have claimed that new parents experience a faster and steeper decline than
childless couples. However, they also found that one out of ten couples experienced a
closer relationship following the birth of their first child. Couples who were mutually
supportive in their new journey of parenthood found increased joy in their marriage
along with their firstborn. However, couples who found their stress increased upon
the birth of a baby experienced a decline in marital happiness.
   For example, consider a husband with a stressful job who, before the arrival of
the baby, comes home to his new wife at the end of the day and gets attention and
pampering. He has time and space to relax and engage in other interests and is able to
unwind. However, once there is a newborn in the family, when he comes home after a
stressful day at work, his wife expects him to help and relieve her after her own long
day of feeding the baby, changing nappies, and soothing endless crying. This sudden
change of lifestyle will understandably take a toll on their marital relationship! Life
will be a bit easier if the couple receives some help and support from their own parents
or a domestic helper, but research also shows that many new parents devote more
time to childcare and less and less time to maintaining their marriage relationship.
Eventually, one parent—most often the father—may start to see their child as a rival
for their partner’s attention and affection, and the relationship will start to deteriorate.



5.5.3 Marital Conflict

Maintaining a loving relationship takes energy and effort. Those who have good
parental models are lucky and perhaps face fewer challenges, have more resources to
support them when they are in need, and have advice and strategies available to help
them solve their marital problems and build strong and happy family relationships.
Today, when support networks are valued, people can establish more supportive
communities to help couples to solve marital conflicts before they lead to a decline
in relationship.
    The literature identifies seven major causes of marital conflict (Billingsley et al.,
2005; Choi & Marks, 2013; Driver & Gottman, 2004; Gottman & Silver, 1994).
These are:
104                                                        5 Family Relationships and EI

1.    Communication: The is key to any relationship. Marital relationships weaken
      when we fail to communicate in a positive manner. Some spouses tend to assume
      that their partner knows and understands what they need and how they feel, and
      many will wait until conflict arises to identify issues and concerns. Few couples
      make time to talk about each other’s needs and how they can help to meet them.
      Some may not be willing to listen, and will react defensively instead. Some
      engage in ineffective communication styles likely learnt from TV shows and
      movies—or from our own parents, such as blaming, criticising, yelling and using
      verbally abusive language to vent anger and resentment instead of wanting to
      solve issues. Couples need to learn to develop positive ways to discuss problems,
      solve them without blame and take action to nurture their relationship to bring it
      to a harmonious state. Knowing how to communicate without being emotional
      is a skill that needs to be learnt and practised.
2.    Expectations and boundaries: Love is blind. When we are madly in love, we
      choose to overlook the flaws and bad habits of our lovers, or to believe that we
      can ‘change them’. As time passes, and we grow more sober, we begin to feel that
      these bad habits are annoying instead. However, attempts to change your spouse
      can be perceived as controlling and invasive, and can result in defensiveness
      and withdrawal. Having unrealistic expectations often ends in disappointment.
      Overstepping personal boundaries will lead to emotional discomfort and clashes.
3.    The decline of sexual intimacy: All couples experience different challenges in
      their sex lives. With the passage of time, some partners may feel less attracted
      to each other. The frequency of sex may start to decline. Couples may also find
      that they have different expectations during sex, including about affection and
      emotional connection during and after sex, who will initiate sex and how, the
      decline of sexual pleasure and fun when sex becomes a routine, disappointment
      with the sexual performance of their spouse, and the decreasing frequency of
      sex in the marriage.
4.    Emotional and sexual infidelity: When people are dissatisfied with their sex
      lives, some may turn to others and engage in extramarital affairs. People are
      unfaithful to their spouses for lots of different reasons. They may be emotion-
      ally drawn to others or magnetised by their physical attraction, the individual’s
      personal qualities, attention they get from the other party that is absent in the
      marriage, or other reasons. Infidelity, whether emotional or sexual, is one of the
      major causes of relationship breakup because the sense of betrayal of trust is
      very hurtful and hard for many to forgive.
5.    Disagreement over money: Financial matters are closely related to a range
      of marital problems and family discord, and long-term disagreements about
      financial management are one of the major causes of fallings-out in marriage.
      Some contributing factors include one partner’s inability or unwillingness to
      budget and save, overspending leading to hefty credit card and other debt,
      unstable income that is inadequate to meet the family’s financial needs, irre-
      sponsible habits such as not paying bills on time, and gambling leading to debt
      crises. Other causes of financial disputes are disagreements about one spouse’s
      controlling style in the directing of spending decisions and other financial and
5.5 Marriage and Family                                                              105

     adjustment problems. Couples with financial planning and management skills
     have been found to enjoy greater marital satisfaction, while those lacking such
     abilities tend to face more marital conflict and dissatisfaction (Dew, 2007; Papp
     et al., 2009).
6.   Values difference: We are all individuals with our own personalities, likes and
     dislikes and life priorities. It is natural that couples sometimes have clashes
     over value differences. Such differences can be related to political affiliations,
     cultural, traditional and religious views, parenting styles and expectations about
     child nurturing, and many other social-economic issues. Couples who are not
     able to be flexible in accepting each other’s views and opinions may experience
     friction in their relationship. On the other hand, couples with high EI respect
     each other’s views, and know how to decline discussions of subjects that will
     lead to heated reactions, and are better able to maintain stable relationships
     within the family (De Groot & Steg, 2010; Djupe & Calfano, 2013; Döring
     et al., 2015).
7.   Personality difference: Couples are attracted to each other for different reasons.
     For some, it is because of the similarities they share; for others, attraction comes
     from the differences in personality that they see in each other. Social psychol-
     ogists and marriage counsellors suggest that personality traits–the factors that
     shape our behaviour, our temperament, and how we interact with others—are one
     key component in marriage satisfaction. They claim that couples with similar
     personalities are likely to share more positive associations with each other in
     both the short and the long term. In contrast, those with huge personality differ-
     ences will experience more turbulence in their relationships (Gonzaga et al.,
     2007; Kardum et al., 2016; Luo & Zhang, 2009).


5.6 Emotional Intelligence in Family Relationships

After the joy of saying ‘I do’ and putting that ring on a loved one’s finger comes
the responsibility of achieving the ‘… and they all lived happily ever after’ part
of the story. This is everyone’s dream when they get married and form their own
family. To live this dream, we need to put in time and effort. Yet as we work to
build the ‘home sweet home’ we’ve planned for, sometimes we get drowned in work
demands, and may choose to spend those extra hours in the office to please the boss
and let our attention to our family slide. Some of us may suppress our anger and
frustration at work and project them onto our family members instead. Some parents
will be so busy tending to the children that they end up ignoring the needs of their
spouses. Couples drift apart when they stop paying attention to each other and to their
own need for love and affection. Without emotional and physical intimacy, family
interaction can become a burden. People can become strangers to each other. EI is
a powerful capability to help us to take control of our own attitudes and behaviours,
and to maintain and sustain meaningful, supportive and loving relationships with our
spouses, siblings and extended families.
106                                                          5 Family Relationships and EI

    Remember, you cannot change others; you can only change yourself. By becoming
more self-aware of your own needs, roles and responsibilities in the family, your
strengths, weaknesses, limitations and potential, you can gain insight into how to
enhance family relationships. You can examine your personality and how it matches
with the personalities of other members of your family. Are you happy with the way
you communicate with them? Do you need to strengthen your communication skills
so that you can make your needs known, discuss issues tactfully and solve problems
using a collaborative approach?
    Many people are constantly unhappy because they dwell in their negative
emotions. However, we can make the choice to feel what we want to feel. By changing
our thoughts and our perspectives, we can learn to let go of unpleasant emotions so
that they do not destroy us. Learn to identify your emotions: ask yourself, Why
am I frustrated, anxious or upset? What is it exactly that I am feeling? What are
these emotions telling me? Am I feeling insecure? jealous? fearful? Of what? Why?
Digging deep into these feelings will open doors and untie knots. Learn to recog-
nise your emotional triggers by asking yourself, Why do I dislike some people (this
person)? What did they do? Is it my bias or did they do something to hurt me? Do I
want to forgive them? How can I learn to be more accepting and less judgemental?
    EI is the ability to understand and monitor our emotions, and recognise what
these emotions are telling us. When we become more self-aware, we are in a better
position to exercise self-control, especially in difficult situations. Pay attention to your
attitudes and behaviours, and you will be able to unearth unconscious destructive
behaviour that is harming your own wellbeing and family relationships—because
the best way to fix any emotional problems in the family is to attend to your own
emotional health first. When you know how to express your emotional needs in an
assertive manner, your family will follow your lead.
    It takes effort to learn to name your emotional issues and use the most appropriate
language to communicate your needs or issues in a way that does not put others on
the defensive. You can start by writing your thoughts down, identifying what changes
you want to see happen, and planning how to best make your needs heard. Knowing
what to do is easy, though; actually putting thoughts into action may take some time
and courage.
    When you have committed to making a change, be sure that you stick to it. Be
consistent, or people will lose trust in you. Focus your energy on what you want
to change. Develop positive self-talk to motivate yourself to stay committed to the
change you need to make. Seek help from trusted friends or professional counsellors
if you have complex issues that you cannot solve. Meditate to free your mind.
    Be other-aware, too. As yourself: What are the needs of my family members? What
can I do to help support their emotional needs? Encourage them to talk by making
it safe for them to express their views. Be open-minded. Be accepting.
    We learn to behave in unacceptable ways from all sorts of sources, from our own
parents to TV dramas and movies. I would argue that over 95% of these TV shows
and movies may do more harm than good to our personal behaviour, our relationships
and how we respond to others. Particularly from reality TV programs and movies,
we learn to judge others with prejudice, and to vent our anger by kicking a chair or
5.6 Emotional Intelligence in Family Relationships                               107

punching a hole in the wall. We learn to see smoking as a stress relief, and Valium
or non-prescription drugs as ways to ‘escape’ our troubles. We are tempted to swear,
curse, hate, criticise, boast, take revenge, manipulate, and engage in all sorts of
behaviours that hurt ourselves and others.
    To be emotionally intelligent is to work on giving up these old bad habits and
forming new, constructive and supportive ones. Instead of promoting revenge, hatred,
violence and negative thoughts and behaviours, we need more pro-social and compas-
sionate stories to help build personal and community EI. Too bad that Hollywood
producers think stories about compassion and being kind to others are old-school
and unmarketable!
    EI gives us the focus, energy and creativity we need to meet the demands of our
different relationships. Develop a high EQ and you will be able to lead a proactive
life, and perhaps even live happily ever after.

Parent–Child Relationships and EI




6.1 Introduction

Parenthood can be a joy for some and a daunting challenge for others. Many of us
are thrown into the deep end and learn to stay afloat while facing the demands and
expectations placed on us to be perfect parents. The truth is, though, that there is
no such thing as a perfect parent. We can only do our best. This chapter shares how
understanding our attachment styles can impact how we relate to others, including
our children. It introduces key child development theories to help parents understand
children’s physical, cognitive, emotional and social growth at different stages of
development. It also discusses various parenting styles and how they affect children’s
emotional growth and regulation, and highlights how parents who have endured trau-
matic childhood experiences can learn to heal their childhood wounds and become
positive, loving and emotionally intelligent parents.



6.2 Parent–Child Relationships

Historically, parenting was a harsh practice. Medieval texts stated that newborns
were burdened with ‘original sin’ and had to be redeemed through harsh treatment
and instruction. For many, especially the less privileged, childhood was brutal, nasty
and almost non-existent. While peasant children were sent to work on the farms or
‘outsourced’ as child labour, the children of the middle and upper classes—especially
boys—were sent away to boarding schools to be ‘educated’ by punitive and merciless
masters. This does not mean that they had unloving parents, though. It was just the
way life was in the past.
   ‘Spare the rod and spoil the child’ was the motto for parenting until approximately
the 1970s, as older readers might recall. And the ‘rod’ was applied not only by parents
but also by educators and child carers. Today, however, social scientists have provided
evidence that when we undermine our relationships with our children in this way,

we also undermine their growth and development. Having a good relationship with
our children is of utmost importance to raising healthy and happy ones.
   A plethora of literature in the past decades has confirmed that the parent–child
relationship is linked to our children’s sense of self-worth and self-esteem, and to
good mental health (e.g., Birkeland et al., 2012; Garber et al., 1997; Kamkar et al.,
2012; Laible et al., 2004; Parker & Benson, 2004). And how our parents treated
us impacts strongly on how we parent our children. Most of us begin parenting by
echoing the parenting styles of our mothers and fathers—and likewise, the way we
treat our children, positively or negatively, is how we are unconsciously teaching
them to be parents in their turn.
   We now live in a very complex world with pressures and challenges from many
different angles. We should no longer allow our children to walk blindly into parent-
hood without heightening their awareness of the importance of positive parenting.
The ability to establish and maintain parent–child connection is vital to creating
healthy parent–child relationships.



6.2.1 Understanding Attachment

The term attachment refers to the bond we have with our parents from birth. Bowlby,
the creator of Attachment Theory, claims that it is ‘a lifespan theory that attempts to
explain human behaviour from cradle to grave’ (Bowlby, 1969, p. 208). Newborns
form attachments with their caregivers (parents, especially their mothers) and begin
to feel secure and contented. Because of this sense of security, the child will have the
courage to explore and learn about their environment with confidence (Moullin et al.,
2014). Bowlby explains that ‘to grow up mentally healthy, the infant and young child
should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or
mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment (Bowlby, 1951,
p. 13).
    Child development literature tells us that secure attachment in healthy parent–child
relationships is related to the development of the frontal cortex, which is respon-
sible for reasoning, judgement and decision-making, and is linked to many positive
outcomes, including brain development and social-emotional development. Children
who feel safe and have a secure attachment to their parents or caregivers are more
likely to experience opportunities that stimulate brain growth, through joyful activ-
ities such as singing, learning to talk and enjoying bedtime stories. When a child
is feeling distressed or insecure, stress hormones take over, but when the parent or
caregiver responds with soothing behaviour to comfort the child, the child learns to
self-regulate, becomes calm and feels less insecure. Additionally, a secure parent–
child attachment leads to the development of trust and empathy for others (Bowlby,
1982; DeBellis & Thomas, 2003; Dozier et al., 2009).
    In addition to this, infants not only learn to decipher the emotions of their primary
caregivers through their touch, body and facial language, and tone of voice, but also
store this emotional information and create mental representations of their attachment
6.2 Parent–child Relationships                                                      115

figure. Bowlby labels these ‘internal working models’ and argues that infants will use
them throughout their lives as soothing mechanisms in times of stress. Bowlby and
subsequent researchers therefore maintain that our early attachment to our mother
or primary caregiver has a profound and unconscious impact on our adult behaviour
(e.g., Ainsworth & Bowlby, 1991; Bowlby, 1969; Cassidy & Shaver, 2008; Cronin,
2003).
   Bowlby (1977) identified two key environmental factors that influence the devel-
opment of mutual attachment between mother and child. The first factor is the oppor-
tunity for attachment. The absence of such opportunity deprives children who are
not cared for by their parents, such as orphans or wards of the state whose parents
may be incapable of caring for them for various reasons, of the chance to form an
attachment with their parents or another significant caregiving figure. The second
factor is the quality of caregiving. Neglectful parents who spend little time bonding
with their children deprive them of the opportunity to form healthy attachments with
adults, risking the development of mental and emotional health issues in later life.
   In a longitudinal study, Schaeffer and Emerson (1964) showed that a healthy
attachment is formed only when the primary caregiver is warm and responsive to the
child. Just spending a lot of time with an infant does not guarantee healthy attachment.
Attachment is formed through the nonverbal emotional communication between the
infant and the caregiver. In fact, impatient parents who fail to soothe the child will
create the opposite of attachment.
   Based on their observations, Schaeffer and Emerson identified four stages of
attachment. These are:
1.   Pre-attachment stage: Infants from birth to 3 months do not show any distinct
     attachment to a specific carer. The infant welcomes any carer who soothes its
     crying and attends to its physical needs.
2.   Indiscriminate attachment: From 6 weeks to 7 months, infants begin to recog-
     nise their primary carer (usually their mother) and begin to bond with her. They
     accept care from any other carer but are able to identify the primary carer and
     respond more strongly to her.
3.   Discriminate attachment: From 7 to 11 months, infants show an estab-
     lished bond with their primary carer or carers (usually mum and dad). They
     develop stranger-anxiety when approached by other, unfamiliar people, and
     show separation anxiety when the primary carer(s) are absent in times of need.
4.   Multiple attachment: From 9 months of age, infants begin to recognise other
     members of the family or caregivers and feel safe with them. They also develop
     attachments with those who respond to them with warmth and love. These carers
     may include their father (if he is not one of the primary caregivers), siblings,
     aunts and uncles, grandparents, and friends of the family.
In 1978, Ainsworth identified four patterns of attachment: secure, insecure/avoidant,
insecure/ambivalent and disorganised/disoriented. The following illustrates how
young children display these attachment patterns.
1.   Secure attachment: A child with secure attachment will be happy to explore
     a new environment (e.g., a playroom). When the parent leaves the room, the
116                                                   6 Parent–Child Relationships and EI

      child will show some signs of separation anxiety, such as crying and worrying.
      However, upon the return of the parent, the child will calm down and resume
      play. Researchers have found that children with secure attachment patterns are
      loved and have learnt to trust others, and are more likely to develop a healthy
      self-image and self-esteem. They are also better able to deal with stress later on
      in life (Dykas & Cassidy, 2007).
2.    Insecure/avoidant attachment: A child with this attachment style does not feel
      safe exploring a new environment even when the parent is present. They may
      be very conscious of the location of the parent even when exploring. When the
      parent leaves the room, the child becomes anxious and distressed, and upon the
      return of the parent, may show anger toward the parent for leaving and refuse to
      continue with any activity in the new environment. Successive research findings
      have supported the belief that children with insecure/avoidant attachment tend
      to be raised in environments that they perceive as stressful and do not receive
      care and soothing attention in times of need. Their caregivers may have rejected
      them or be emotionally unavailable. This lack of affective connection distorts the
      infants’ mental representation of self-image and their sense of security (Gullone
      et al., 2006). Children with insecure/avoidant attachment are also found to be
      less able to cope with emotional situations and to experience delays in childhood
      development.
3.    Insecure/ambivalent attachment: A child with this attachment style does
      not show strong attachment to their mother or caregiver. This may be due
      to neglect or unloving parenting, or to inconsistent parenting behaviours in
      which, for example, parents are overly attentive at some times and neglectful at
      others. Such children may not cry when their parents leave the room; however,
      they show signs of avoidance when the parents return, appearing unemotional.
      These children tend to focus more on the toys and objects of interests in the
      room than the people in that environment. Individuals who grow up with
      insecure/ambivalent attachment patterns tend to have a negative self-image,
      lack empathy, be distrustful of others, and believe that they are not worthy of
      love. They are at greater risk of developing depression, anxiety and addictions
      (Bifulco et al., 2002).
4.    Disorganised/disoriented attachment: A child with this attachment style
      displays disorganised and mixed behaviour in the presence of their mother or
      caregiver, and may seem dazed or confused. They do not show a clear attach-
      ment to their caregiver and may ‘freeze’ in a new environment, not knowing
      what to do. When their parent returns to the room, this child may raise their arms
      to be picked up, but not make eye contact with their caregiver. This indicates an
      avoidance behaviour despite the child’s need to be soothed, suggesting that the
      caregiver is a source of both desired comfort and fear. Infants who show this type
      of attachment style are likely to have been raised in a highly stressful environ-
      ment or abused by their caregiver(s) in early development, causing an inability to
      regulate their emotions, and they may be traumatised (Cassidy & Mohr, 2001).
      Some have learnt to dissociate from reality to avoid further hurt, and many feel
      powerless when faced with stress (Creeden, 2004; Main & Solomon, 1986).
6.2 Parent–child Relationships                                                    117

The causes of insecure attachment may include:
• Parents/caregivers who lack the necessary parenting skills and knowledge to
  provide emotional support for their infant.
• Parents/caregivers who are uncaring or irresponsible and who neglect their child
  both physically and emotionally.
• Parents/caregivers who have health or emotional problems that deprive them of
  the time and energy they need to pay attention to their infant.
• Parents/caregivers who have chronic problems and personal difficulties (e.g.,
  poverty, drug addiction or mental illness).
• Parents/caregivers who are separated from the child due divorce, illness, etc.
• Infants being cared for inconsistently by multiple different family members or
  institutions due to changing circumstances (e.g., the death of a parent, war, crime
  and addiction, entering foster care).
Bowlby (1977), Ainsworth (1978) and other theorists believe that the early attach-
ment formed with a child’s primary caregiver has a significant impact on their phys-
ical, emotional and psychological health, and the development of social relation-
ships throughout their life. A mother’s attachment to her child is powerful and
has a profound and unconscious impact on adult behaviour. However, readers are
cautioned that these are data from a sample of psychological observations, and not to
over-associate these data with their own experiences. Nonetheless, a safe and loving
environment with quality parental care is still vital in the first stage of our lives.



6.2.2 Adult Attachment Styles

Building on Bowlby’s Attachment Theory, Bartholomew and Horowitz (1991)
presented a model of adult attachment styles to assess attachment styles in social
and interpersonal relationships. This model also includes four attachment styles,
namely secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant. The
following is a brief description of these styles (Sable, 2008).
1.   Secure attachment: Individuals who demonstrate this style of attachment hold
     a positive self-image and a positive view of others. They find it easy to become
     emotionally close to others and are seldom worried about being alone or not
     being accepted. They are likely to have felt secure throughout their child-
     hood, and thus are able to develop responsive interactions with others. Securely
     attached adults feel contented with both independence and intimacy. They are
     usually emotionally available to those who need them and responsive, caring
     and loving parents to their children, forming secure attachments with them.
     They are also capable of regulating their positive and negative emotions.
2.   Anxious-preoccupied attachment: Individuals who display this style of attach-
     ment tend to have negative views of themselves and others. They worry that
     others do not value them, and therefore have difficulties forming friendships or
118                                                    6 Parent–Child Relationships and EI

      relationships with others, often believing that others are rejecting them or failing
      to acknowledge their presence. They seek high levels of approval and respon-
      siveness from their attached figure, and have a tendency to be overly dependent
      on that figure. When they do not gain the attention or response they desire from
      others, they may blame themselves and doubt their self-worth. They may also
      show high levels of worry, impulsiveness and emotional dysregulation in their
      relationships.
3.    Dismissive-avoidant attachment: Individuals with this style of attachment
      pattern usually have a positive self-view but a negative view of others. They
      tend to be very independent and self-sufficient, and prefer not to depend on
      others. Likewise, they would prefer that others not depend on them. They are
      comfortable without any close relationships and avoid attachment altogether.
      They are generally unconsciously defensive, and tend to suppress and hide their
      emotions, even from themselves. They cope with rejection and relational conflict
      by distancing themselves, choosing self-isolation and avoidance.
4.    Fear-avoidant attachment: Individuals with this style of attachment have
      unstable views of themselves and others. Many are uncomfortable getting close
      to others, and find it hard to trust them enough to form a relationship. They tend
      to be self-protective and will employ a range of defensive mechanisms to protect
      themselves from hurt. They are more likely to have suffered abuse in their child-
      hood that prompts them to build barriers to emotional closeness, although they
      may also crave emotional bonds with others. They find it difficult to express
      their affection for fear of being abandoned by their loved ones, and therefore
      choose to be emotionally distant. Individuals with this attachment style are also
      prone to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety disorders.
Bowlby (1969) informs us that our adult attachment patterns are likely to be contin-
uations of our childhood attachment styles. However, other researchers suggest that
adult attachment is also influenced by, and may change because of, the events and
encounters that we experience in our later childhood or teen years, and our relation-
ships with others through the different stages of development (Brennan et al., 1998;
Fraley & Shaver, 1997).



6.2.3 Attachment, Emotion Regulation, and Interpersonal
      Relationships

Bowlby’s Attachment Theory has also been used to study emotion regulation in chil-
dren and adults. Investigations into parent–child attachment have shown that when
an infant does not experience reliable or consistent protection and loving support
from their caregivers, they can develop anxiety or avoidance as a coping mechanism.
Recent studies have also shown that attachment styles are associated with distinct
emotional profiles. Those with secure attachment styles are more confident, calm and
6.2 Parent–child Relationships                                                        119

composed when confronted with emotional challenges, and are more able to regu-
late their emotions, whereas those with insecure attachment styles have difficulties
controlling their emotions and are more prone to anger, depression and other nega-
tive emotions. They also tend to display coercive and hostile, dominating behaviours
when faced with conflict in interpersonal relationships. (Consedine & Magai, 2006;
Schore & Schore, 2008; Schimmenti et al., 2014).
    A gender difference is also noted amongst those who show anxious-avoidant
attachment styles. Women with these attachment styles tend to be more intense in
their displays of hostility and distress during relational discord, and are more likely to
be dominating and defensive than men (Woodin, 2011). Contrastingly, women with
secure attachment style tend to react constructively during conflict, be less defensive
and show a commitment to resolving disagreements. They are also more affectionate
and more likely to show empathy to others, accommodate others’ flaws, and are more
forgiving than men (Campbell et al., 2005; Shi, 2003).
    Individuals who feel insecure as children carry this sense of insecurity into adult-
hood. They are likely to have a difficult time adjusting to a new or unfamiliar
environments, such as when moving from primary school to high school, changing
jobs or moving to a new country. They also have difficulty understanding their own
emotions, expressing those emotions in appropriate ways and regulating them when
under stress. People with insecure attachment styles also have difficulties forming
friendships and other social-interpersonal relationships.



6.3 Theories that Guide Parenting

Our grandparents and parents, many of whom might have been victims of cruel
parenting themselves, had little access to knowledge and skills about positive
parenting. Today, we are lucky to be informed by an ocean of research on the different
aspects of healthy parenting, and the consequences of poor parenting too. Section 6.1
reviewed Attachment Theory, one of the most prominent theories that informs us
about how the way we bond with our children affects them throughout their lifespan.
This section presents other common theories that support positive parenting. Most of
these theories are part of the professional education of teachers, child psychologists,
social workers and other people working with children. However, not many parents
get the chance to learn about them. For parents who want to develop increased EI,
having some knowledge of these theories will be helpful.



6.3.1 Behavioural Theories

The earliest teaching of the behavioural approach to child rearing was quite bizarre.
In the 1920s, John Watson, the founder of the Behavioural Approach, taught that
human behaviour could be shaped by stimuli-response factors, which he named
120                                                  6 Parent–Child Relationships and EI

classical conditioning. He believed that many of our emotional responses are learnt,
and applied his theory of classical conditioning to demonstrate how children learn
fear. However, in those early days, the focus on child emotional development was
thought to be conditioned by external factors and stimuli. Watson therefore warned
parents not to love their children too much: ‘Never hug and kiss them, never let them
sit in your lap. If you must, kiss them once on the forehead when you say goodnight.
Shake hands with them in the morning. Give them a pat on the shoulder when they
have done a good job’ (Watson, 1928, p. 81).
    In the 1940s, American psychologist B. K. Skinner introduced the concept of
operant conditioning and used it to help teachers and educators support behavioural
change as part of classroom management (Skinner, 1963). The difference between
classical conditioning and operant conditioning is that the former involves associ-
ating an involuntary response with a stimulus, while the latter is about associating
behaviour with a consequence. The basic concept of operant conditioning is that a
stimulus (an antecedent) leads to a behaviour, which also leads to a consequence. For
example, a child sees a toy in a toy shop (stimulus/antecedent) and wants it. Their
mother says ‘No’. The child throws a tantrum and cries loudly (behaviour). The
mother, wanting to avoid embarrassment, buys the child the toy (the consequence).
So the child has learnt that throwing a tantrum will get them the desired result. This
example illustrates Skinner’s teaching—that a target behaviour is followed by rein-
forcement, which will either strengthen or weaken that behaviour. In this case, the
mother has given the child a negative reinforcement: tantrum equals toy.
    In operant conditioning, both positive and negative reinforcement will increase a
behaviour, whether good or bad. When an adult responds to a child who is behaving
appropriately (for example, keeping his room tidy as required) by buying them a toy
as a reward, that is positive reinforcement. Conversely, when a child behaves badly
and demands a toy, and the parent yields to such behaviour and buys the child a toy as
a bribe to behave better, they are giving the child negative reinforcement. Operant
conditioning is part of the Behavioural Approach used commonly in the last century.
    Teachers and parents have been using the Behavioural Approach to shape chil-
dren’s behaviour for three or four decades. However, contemporary social scien-
tists have raised the issue of using punishment—especially physical punishment,
which has been shown to be associated with increased child aggression, antisocial
behaviour, mental health problems such as fear and anxiety, and poorer quality of
parent–child relationships. (Siegel & Bryson, 2014). In one early research study,
Alberto and Troutman (1990), found that 90% of American parents used spanking
as a punishment. Physical punishments such as spanking, hitting and slapping were
common before the 1970s. Now there is legislation in some countries that makes
these unlawful, because it is known to do more harm than good in helping children
develop self-regulation skills. Even the use of ‘time out’, a technique designed to give
an angry child some time and space to calm down before having a rational discussion,
is considered an inappropriate method for teaching behavioural management.
    Parents and teachers are therefore warned to use ‘time out’ cautiously. Siegel
and Bryson (2014) warn that when children are sent to a quiet corner or a different
room for ‘time out’, they can feel rejected and shamed, especially if it happens in
6.3 Theories that Guide Parenting                                                    121

the classroom. This will harm the child’s self-esteem, and may even arouse more
anger. If a child is sent to the time out room at school frequently, they may also start
to use it as an escape to avoid tasks they do not enjoy. Siegel and Bryson (2014)
therefore advise parents and teachers not to use time out as a consequence for poor
behaviour, but only as a true break to give an angry or distressed child time to calm
down. Follow-up actions must be taken as soon as the child comes out from ‘time
out’ to reassure them that they are not being punished. Adults (parents or teachers)
must make sure they listen to the child’s side of the story, and reinforce a positive
parent–child or teacher-student connection.



6.3.2 Cognitive Developmental Theory

The Cognitive Developmental Theory developed by Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget
(1929) focuses on how children learn and understand their environments, and how
they think and acquire knowledge. He suggests that children grow through four
different stages of mental development.
1.   Sensorimotor stage: From birth to around age 2, a child learns mainly from
     sensory perceptions and motor activities. In their first six months of their lives,
     they have limited memory and do not have a sense of object permanence. This
     means that when an object is hidden from sight, they think it has ceased to
     exist. However, that does not really matter to the child as they will switch their
     attention to other interesting objects or people.
2.   Pre-operational stage: From ages 2 to 6, a child learns to understand and use
     language. Children at this stage are able to think at a symbolic level but are
     not ready to use words and sentences in a sophisticated way to organise their
     thoughts and ideas. They are, however, very good at using their imaginations
     and playing imagination games.
3.   Concrete operational stage: From ages 2 to 11, children are able to use
     language and understand rules. They begin to think logically, but many are
     still confined to thinking in terms of concrete events and physical things, and
     unable to understand abstract or hypothetical concepts. They can only think in
     terms of operational thoughts.
4.   Formal operational stage: From age 12 on, children develop the ability to
     understand abstract concepts. They progressively develop logical thinking,
     deductive reasoning, and systematic planning.
Piaget’s Cognitive Developmental Theory is widely used in education and school
systems worldwide to guide curriculum and learning activities. Knowledge of these
stages of development, and other aspects of the Cognitive Developmental Theory,
can be helpful for parents as it lets them know what to expect at the different stages of
their children’s cognitive development. This will help them to decide what to provide
their children with, and when, in order to support their developmental growth.
122                                                    6 Parent–Child Relationships and EI

6.3.3 Psychosocial Development Theory

American psychologist Erik Erikson, after years of studying children and society,
developed his psychosocial development theory, which describes eight stages of
development (Erikson, 1958). Erikson believed that we all pass through these eight
stages, and that each stage builds on the previous one. In our journey of life, moreover,
we face different challenges—at least one crisis at each stage. When we are able to
resolve that crisis, we gain maturity and move on to the next stage. This helps us to
gain psychological strength and become confident and mentally strong.
   The eight stages of psychosocial development described by Erikson (1958) are:
1.    Trust vs mistrust: From birth to about age 18 months, infants form bonds and
      attachments with their mother/primary caregiver. When the mother/caregiver is
      consistent with their nurture, love and care, the baby learns to trust and depend
      on them. However, if the mother/caregiver is inconsistent in their responsiveness
      with the child, this trusting bond will be unstable or absent. Erikson believes
      that the development of trust at the infant stage is the basis of the child’s forming
      a sense of identity. Without trust, the infant will feel insecure and sense that the
      world is inconsistent and unreliable.
2.    Autonomy vs shame and doubt: From age 1 to 3, children begin to discover
      independence, from taking their first step to being allowed to self-feed and do
      a lot of basic tasks like putting on their shoes or operating a toy. If children are
      pressured by anxious parents who limit their freedom to explore their environ-
      ment or try new things, they will be deprived of a sense of autonomy and may
      become over-reliant. At the same time, if they are laughed at when they fail
      to complete a task on their own, they may fail to develop confidence in them-
      selves. For example, children in this age group are generally learning toileting
      skills, and if parents reprimand children for wetting themselves during the day,
      or wetting their beds at night, this can cause them to develop feelings of shame.
      Erikson advises that positive parental support is vital at this stage to ensure the
      development of self-confidence and autonomy. A lack of support will not help
      the child to develop self-control and self-esteem.
3.    Initiative vs. guilt: From the age of 3 to 5, children develop the ability to do
      things on their own. They need to develop a sense of purpose in the things they do.
      Some will start making their own decisions and have confidence in leading others
      in games and learning activities at school. They will also become very curious
      and ask a lot of questions to try and understand their world. When children
      are not allowed to interact with others during social activities, or not given the
      opportunity to lead or initiate play, they risk becoming socially deprived and not
      developing the social skills they will need later in life. If they are ridiculed for
      asking too many questions, they can start to feel guilty for being too inquisitive.
      Involving a child in planning or making decisions at home or at school can give
      them a sense of purpose and develop their feelings of pride and self-worth.
4.    Industry vs. inferiority: From age 5 to 12, children start to develop a sense
      of competence. They are old enough to compare themselves with others. In
6.3 Theories that Guide Parenting                                                  123

     traditional classrooms where learning is measured by academic success and test
     scores, children who are less academically successful can therefore develop a
     sense of inferiority. Teachers and parents are advised to identify the talents and
     interests of each child to help build their confidence. Children in this age group
     also love to be engaged in activities such as art, sports, music, magic and play.
     Strict parents who do not allow children to engage in these social activities will
     also deprive them of the opportunity to grow socially and intellectually.
5.   Identity vs. confusion: As children transition from childhood to adolescence,
     between the ages of 12 and 18, they begin to think about their identity (who
     am I?) and their purpose in life (what do I want to do in life?). This is the
     stage at which they form their beliefs and values, and develop morality. At this
     stage, many turn to peers for support, especially if they do not gain the support
     they need from their parents and families. Peer influence will thus sway their
     behaviour and ideals. However, when these youngsters receive positive parental
     support (and school support), they are much more likely to form a healthy and
     strong self-identity. Without such supports, a young person may not be able to
     develop a strong sense of self, which can lead to a confusing and problematic
     adulthood.
6.   Intimacy vs isolation: From the ages of 18 to 40, individuals look for love and
     relationships. Through supportive friendships, positive family relationships and
     loving relationships, they find satisfaction in fulfilling their need for love and
     intimacy. This gives them a sense of belonging and acceptance, and a sense
     of safety, care and commitment. However, those without healthy family rela-
     tionships during childhood, or those with special challenges, may encounter
     difficulties in forming meaningful, fulfilling and intimate relationships with
     others, resulting in isolation and a sense of rejection, loneliness, and lack of
     self-worth.
7.   Generativity vs. stagnation: Between the ages of 40 and 60, most people have
     established a career or maintained a job and an independent livelihood. Some
     have married and had children, while others have made productive contributions
     to their society in other ways. However, if a person has not achieved any of these
     life events, (e.g., still living with mum at age 45, not married, no job, no life
     purpose), they may feel uncomfortable about this ‘stagnation’, feel regret and
     develop a sense of uselessness.
8.   Integrity vs despair: As people enter their senior years, from age 65 onwards,
     many have accepted whatever pain and challenges they have faced in their life
     journey. They have developed the wisdom to ‘let it be’. Many are proud of their
     life achievements and feel a genuine satisfaction when looking back. However,
     people who have failed to complete the previous stages of life, according to
     Erikson, may look back at their lives with feelings of loss and regret. Some may
     even fall into depression.
124                                                 6 Parent–Child Relationships and EI

Erikson’s theory informs us of how our different social experiences at each stage of
our life play a role in our psychosocial development and growth. Having a knowl-
edge of this theory helps us understand the social nature of human beings and recog-
nise the importance social influence and parenting, and how they shape our social
development, especially in the first five stages of life.



6.3.4 Social Learning Theory

Social Learning Theory is a combination of cognitive development theory and
behavioural theory, with an added social element. In the 1960s, Canadian-American
psychologist Albert Bandura developed this theory to illustrate how we, as children,
learn through observation of our role models (Bandura, 1968). These role models
can be our parents, teachers, friends and family members, and also book and tele-
vision characters, which he classified as live models, symbolic models and verbal
instructional models. Bandura believes that the reward and punishment methods used
in classical and operational conditioning, described in the Behavioural Approach
section above, are insufficient to change behaviour. He stresses the importance of
role models to guide a child in making behavioural changes.
    While working with aggressive children in the early 1960s, Bandura studied how
and why children behave aggressively. He discovered that observational learning is
one of the major factors leading to aggressive behaviour. In a well-known experiment,
the ‘Bobo doll’ experiment, Bandura proved that children would repeat aggressive
behaviour after watching what an adult model did to the Bobo doll. He also found
that children would be more likely to copy the behaviour of models of the same sex
rather than those of the opposite sex.
    The Social Learning Theory is considered by many to be a bridge between cogni-
tive and behaviourist learning theories, because it emphasises cognitive processes
such as attention, memory and motivation. Bandura believes that people can learn
to change their behaviour without either rewards or punishment, but also that that
learning might not actually result in a behaviour change (Bandura, 1997). He main-
tains that people learn through observation, imitation and modelling. While prac-
titioners of Behavioural Theory use positive and negative reinforcement to insti-
gate behavioural change, Bandura found that people make changes due to their
own intrinsic reinforcement—things that matter to them, like their pride, sense of
achievement, need to connect with others, etc. (Bandura, 1986).
    According to Bandura, individuals do not just imitate others. There are cognitive
processes involved in learning taking place. These mediational processes include:
1.    Attention: To learn something, it is necessary to pay attention. We come across
      hundreds of events every day, but we learn only from the ones that we pay
      attention to. No matter what you try to teach your children, if they do not pay
      attention to what is taught, there will be no learning involved.
6.3 Theories that Guide Parenting                                                      125

2.   Retention: People do not learn by just observing others once or twice. The infor-
     mation has to go through our memory and be processed cognitively (consciously
     or unconsciously). This means that learning something, especially a behavioural
     change, is a slow process. It does not happen overnight.
3.   Reproduction: Change requires action—the ability to do something to achieve
     a goal. Therefore, the ability to change and the willingness to change are both
     important factors in enabling a person to reach their target or desired goal/s and
     create change.
4.   Motivation: Motivation is a key factor in change. Unlike the Behavioural
     Theory, the Social Learning Theory teaches that reward and punishment do not
     always work. If a child is always punished for behaving inappropriately, they
     will learn to ignore the consequence, or even abuse the process. For example,
     if a child knows that they be sent to the time out room or suspended for bad
     behaviour, they may use this as a way to avoid classroom tasks they dislike.
     However, if a child is motivated to change through what is important to him/her,
     and given guidance and modelling, genuine change can take place.
Another of Bandura’s key teaching points is the concept of self-efficacy. Bandura
(1986) explains that self-efficacy is part of our self-esteem, comprising our attitudes,
abilities and cognitive skills. It is how we see ourselves, and whether we believe
in our ability to achieve something—for example, making a behavioural change.
Efficacy beliefs affect how we think optimistically or pessimistically, which drives
our self-enhancing or self-debilitating behaviours when we have to complete a task
or fulfil a goal. It involves both intrinsic (internal) and extrinsic motivations (material
rewards, social rewards). It also plays a central role in self-regulation for overcoming
challenges and managing our expectations of outcome.
    The principles of the Social Learning Theory are very useful for parents. Having
the knowledge and skills needed to facilitate these principles can help them to provide
a reassuring environment for their children, be aware of how they as role models
influence their children, understand how intrinsic motivation works in order to help
their children develop appropriate behaviour, and understand how self-efficacy drives
the achievement of goals.
    This section has introduced a few key theories of human development to help
parents to understand themselves and how their journey from childhood to adult-
hood might have shaped their beliefs, values, thoughts and behaviours. Professionals
working with children are educated about the different aspects of child develop-
ment, and these theories help them to understand how children develop at different
stages, physically, psychologically and emotionally. By understanding these different
stages of development, parents can learn how to enrich their children’s learning
opportunities and enhance their growth and development. They can also understand
why some children have difficulties and challenges in their thinking, reasoning, and
social-emotional development.

6.4 Parenting Styles and Positive Parenting

Parenting can be a lifelong process. When our children are young, we have the
responsibility to meet their basic needs by providing them with warm and safe shelter,
nutritious food, clothing, medical care and protection from harm. But we must also
provide them with the support they need to develop physically, cognitively, psycho-
logically and emotionally. Unlike our grandparents and parents, we now know how
important positive parenting is in developing strong and affectionate relationships
with our children that are based on communication and mutual respect. By under-
standing their needs at different developmental stages, we can give them the support
they need to enrich their lives.
    One aspect of enhancing our children’s growth is helping them develop emotional
competence—that is, the ability to understand their feelings, express them suitably,
and regulate their emotions at different situations and social contexts. By providing
them with guidance and opportunities to develop interpersonal and social skills,
we increase their ability to express and regulate their emotions in a healthy way,
thus reducing their chance of experiencing mental health issues and behavioural
challenges. As illustrated in Sect. 6.2, parents serve as role models to their children.
This means that how we express or suppress our emotions will be watched and copied
by those children.
    It is natural for young children to react with strong emotions in situations that they
do not understand or have not experienced before. As they are not able to express
themselves verbally, they communicate through their behaviour—for example, by
crying or having tantrums. Parents who understand that these situations are attempts
to communicate will be able to soothe their children and teach them how to express
these feelings better as they get older. However, parents who are not prepared may
respond in different ways, which might encourage inappropriate behaviours instead,
leading to behavioural challenges later on. There is increasing evidence to show
that children with poor emotional competence and self-regulation have difficulties
when transitioning to school, and are more likely to experience peer rejection, have
behavioural problems and be at risk for low academic achievement (Cohen et al.,
2005; Denham, 1986; McClelland et al., 2006).
    Through years of observational studies and empirical research, Murray, Rosan-
balm and Christopoulos (2016) have identified how skilled parents are able to soothe
their infants when they are emotionally distressed. They call this ‘co-regulating’. By
interacting with them in a warm, responsive way, the parent or caregiver helps the
infant to switch their attention away from the stressor and engage with something
else that serves as a resource for comfort. Soon, the infant learns to self-soothe. For
example, if a baby cries when their mother leaves to go shopping, their father might
hold the child and play some soothing music to calm them down. Soon, the child
will learn to calm down by themselves when they hear that music.
    As the child gets older (age 1 to 3) and begins to understand more, parents can
teach the child to calm down by sitting with them and modelling calm behaviour. This
is called ‘mood mirroring’. Parents can talk calmly to children and teach them about
6.4 Parenting Styles and Positive Parenting                                         127

rules and consequences. Children are receptive when an adult responds to them with
a warm and affective tone, tempo of speech, touch, and eye gaze. But parents must
also be patient and firm about delaying gratification, and be consistent in responding
to tantrums by staying calm and waiting out the tantrum—for example, ignoring the
tantrum, not making eye contact with the child and continuing to do whatever they
are doing instead, and then, when the tantrum is over, acknowledging the child’s
strong feelings and teaching them a more appropriate way to behave. At the same
time, they can teach about rules and priorities, and how to regulate strong emotions.
    Parenting styles also affect our children’s behavioural and emotional development.
In a series of studies, Baumrind (1971) showed that different parenting styles have
different impacts on our children’s social-emotional development. The four parenting
styles described by Baumrind include:
1.   Authoritarian parenting: These parents use strict disciplinary measures—fear
     and punishment—to deal with children’s behaviour. Communication is mostly
     one-way, from parent to child. Parents do not bother to understand the chal-
     lenges their children are facing. Expectations placed on children are high, and
     there is little negotiation. Children with these parents are at a higher risk of
     developing low self-esteem, becoming angry and aggressive, and developing
     anxiety disorders later in life.
2.   Authoritative parenting: Authoritative parenting is very different from authori-
     tarian parenting. Authoritative parents set rules and boundaries, and they explain
     to their children the reasons behind the rules. They also take the children’s feel-
     ings into consideration, even when they fail to follow the rules. These parents
     also put in a lot of time and effort to develop affectionate connections with
     their children and help them to develop self-discipline and self-esteem. Chil-
     dren raised by authoritative parents are more likely to grow up to be confident
     and responsible adults, who are willing to express their feelings and opinions.
     They are also more likely to make good decisions and become positive parents
     themselves.
3.   Permissive parenting: These parents sometimes overprotect their children
     because they are too accommodating. They set rules but do not enforce them, let
     their children get away with mischief and do not teach them about consequences.
     They are more likely to be manipulated by their children, and to fail to teach
     them about poor choices. Some children with permissive parents may struggle
     academically and exhibit more behavioural problems, developing a ‘couldn’t
     care less’ attitude towards authority, rules and regulations. Others may develop
     health issues such as obesity or addictions later on in life because they have
     been taught poor health choices and decision-making.
4.   Uninvolved parenting: In today’s demanding world, many parents struggle to
     balance the demands of and parenting. This is especially true for single parents.
     Uninvolved parents are those who spend little time with their children, whether
     by their own choice or because of circumstances beyond their control. Intention-
     ally or unintentionally, they neglect their children’s basic needs. Some children
     with uninvolved parents learn to be resilient and look after themselves and even
128                                                  6 Parent–Child Relationships and EI

      their younger siblings. However, others can feel unloved and abandoned. They
      may do poorly at school, have low social and emotional skills, and be generally
      withdrawn and unhappy.
Most of us learn parenting skills by mirroring how our parents treated us. Some
of us learn from our siblings and friends, while others do so via trial and error—a
somewhat ‘on-the-job’ form of training. Today’s parents are luckier. There are lots
of books, videos and websites available to help parents cope with the challenges
they will meet in their journey of parenthood. In many places, there are also parent
support groups available to help young parents share their experiences and parenting
strategies. Pre-parenting workshops are one of the best ways for soon-to-be parents
to prepare for successful parenthood.



6.5 Childhood Trauma and Parenting

We live in a very complex world. A recent report in Pediatrics journal noted that over
half of all children globally (1 billion children aged 2–17) experience violence or
some form of trauma every year. In the years between 2015 and 2016, at least 64%
of children in Asia, 56% in North America, 50% in Africa, 34% in Latin America,
and 12% in Europe suffered traumatising experiences (Hillis et al., 2016). These
traumatic experiences include: physical or sexual abuse; psychological abuse and
neglect; kidnapping and child-trafficking; family or community violence; natural
disasters; terrorism; refugee or war experiences; separation from parents due to
divorce, incarceration or addiction; and the loss of parent/s to death. Being caught
up in, or witnessing, a violent and traumatic event can have a tremendous impact on
a child’s physical, psychological and emotional wellbeing, including delays in the
development of cognition, language and learning, and a positive self-identity. These
experiences can affect children for a long time if they are not given professional help.
   Children who lose their families are frequently placed in institutions such as
orphanages, or in foster homes, but although they are removed from the unsafe envi-
ronment where their suffering occurred, these children do not necessarily receive the
nurturing and care that they need from their natural parents or caregivers. Unresolved
trauma can impact on their mental health, causing post-traumatic stress disorder or
PTSD. Symptoms of PTSD include disturbed sleeping patters and nightmares, intru-
sive thoughts or images, flashbacks to painful and frightful experiences, intense
distress at real or symbolic reminders of trauma, panic attacks, irritability, anxiety,
aggressiveness and anger, mood swings and being easily startled (Pico-Alfonso et al.,
2006).
   Traumatised children are at higher risk of developing low self-worth, a persistent
sense of guilt and shame, and self-doubt. They may be ridden with negative beliefs
and thoughts such as ‘I am a bad person because I was abused’, or ‘I am cursed,
nothing good will happen to me’, or ‘I will always be a bad person and nothing will
change that’ (Berntsen & Rubin, 2007). As a result of their separation from their
6.5 Childhood Trauma and Parenting                                                  129

parents, these children tend to develop disorganised attachment styles, which will
affect their own parenting experiences later on in life.
    In other words, early life trauma and adversity also makes it much harder for
such individuals to be responsive parents and to develop a healthy attachment with
their children. Studies also show that pregnant women with depression or PTSD
are at higher risk for slowed foetal growth, premature birth, and low infant birth
weight (Muzik & Borovska, 2010). Similarly, children born to mothers with PTSD
tend to show greater physical, behavioural and psychological challenges, and more
developmental delays (Deave et al., 2008).
    Parenting through a lens of trauma affects both the quality of parent–child attach-
ment and the development of the children. Studies on the association between child-
hood trauma and parenting difficulties in later life shows that parents who have lived
through childhood traumatic experiences tend to show reduced affection, empathy
and consistency in their parenting styles (Tarczon, 2012). They tend to be more
permissive and have difficulties setting boundaries, as they equate this with asserting
power over their children (DiLillo & Damasheck, 2003). However, some may go in
the opposite direction and become too harsh on their children, because they have diffi-
culty regulating their own emotions to cope with their children’s demands (Banyard
et al., 2003), and resort to punitive measures as a form of discipline, as this is what
they have learnt from their own childhoods (Barrett, 2009).
    In addition, studies of mothers who experienced sexual abuse as children found
that they can become emotionally dependent on their children and see them as a
source of comfort, and can also have difficulty forming physically intimate bonds
with their babies. For example, one mother stated, ‘It always amazed me that how
a beautiful experience like breastfeeding could be, yet, for me, it is such a trauma’
(Wood & Esterik, 2010, p. 138).
    Fathers who experienced sexual abuse as children, in contrast, tend to be physically
and emotionally distant from their children out of fear of becoming abusive parents
themselves (Wark & Vis, 2016). Some, still living under the shadow of their childhood
trauma, fear that they will hurt their children in the same way. One father explained,
‘It would cross my mind sometimes with diapering them, I never touched them or
anything like that, but just, it would cross my mind as far as that’ (O’Dougherty-
Wright et al., 2012, p. 544). Another said, ‘He’s got a lot of rage, that’s why I worry
about my son… I don’t want him to be a violent person’ (Kistin et al., 2014, p. 195).
    Some parents who were orphaned young feel that they have no models to copy
from, and strongly doubt their ability to be effective parents, saying ‘How could I
possibly be a good mom? I don’t know anything about parenting. I’d never seen it’
(Hall, 2011, p. 33), or ‘I hardly ever feel that I am good enough, I am so preoccupied
with everything that I do wrong’ (Tedgård et al., 2018, p. 7).
    Some are intensely wary of forming emotional attachments with their children,
for fear of rejection or because of a lack of experience of being loved: ‘I have a tough
time being affectionate with them, showing them the love they deserve. I couldn’t
really form a real close bond because there is a child in me that I believe I haven’t
accepted’ (Cavanaugh et al., 2015, p. 513). Some, in contrast, become so unhealthily
attached to their children that they experience separation anxiety when their children
130                                                  6 Parent–Child Relationships and EI

go to school: ‘I have never been away from my children… no, no, I will die… I can
hardly breathe if I even think about it’ (Tedgård et al., 2018, p. 7).
    Fortunately, there are also many happy stories in the literature about victims of
childhood traumas who have become parents. For some, parenthood is blissful, the
beginning of a new and happier life—for example, as one young mother said, ‘These
children show me unconditional love, and I didn’t know that before’ (Cavanaugh
et al., 2015, p. 512). Another said, ‘Everything changed, everything was so different…
The world looks better to me, it made a little more sense … I know why I am here, I
need to be a mom’ (Aparicio et al., 2015, p. 51). For some, parenthood is a healing
process that helps them find peace: ‘There is an internal peace that I can actually
achieve at times now, which is lovely. I think I’m also willing to accept a deeper
sense of satisfaction in being a parent’ (O’Dougherty-Wright et al., 2012, p. 547).
    Many people who have lived through traumatising childhoods need help and
support, especially when they become parents (Muzik & Borovska, 2010). However,
many have no one to turn to for support, because they do not have family members
or friends. Some are wary of judgement from others, while others have experienced
unhelpful therapies or interventions in the past. Some are also fearful that unhelpful
professionals will see them as unfit parents and take their children away (Hall, 2011).
Studies have found that interventions that only address their parenting skills without
addressing their mental health needs and histories of trauma are unhelpful (Reyno &
McGrath, 2006).
    There are programs available to help such at-risk mothers in the USA, which
incorporate treatment for anxiety, depression and trauma-related stress, as well as
support in developing parenting support skills. These programs are usually long-
term and include home visitations. Some examples include the CHILD first program
(Lowell et al., 2011), and child-parent-psychotherapy (Lieberman, 2004). One of the
more prominent programs is the Mom Power program, run by Michigan University
(Muzik et al., 2015). This program incorporates both group and individual sessions,
and includes an attachment-based parenting education program, reflective consul-
tation, and psychotherapy. Participants in the program are taught how to seek out
and enhance peer and social support, and how to seek and accept support. They
are helped to feel comfortable socialising and sharing their parenting experiences
and problems with others. Mothers involved in the program are also shown how to
develop responsiveness with their infants, and taught about the importance of parent–
child attachment. Program facilitators help them to identify and address children’s
emotional needs at different stages of development, and use a balanced approach to
help children regulate their emotions and learn self-discipline. Finally, there is also
a self-care component that teaches mothers how to reduce their own stress and be
‘in the moment’ when they are bonding with their children. Participants in the Mom
Power program are given a self-care toolkit which helps them to learn to relax, feel
safe, and develop positive thoughts and ways to cope with different sources of stress.
And there are ‘hands-on’ sessions to practise skills and individual coaching to cater
for individual needs (Muzik et al., 2015).
    Parenting education and family support like this should be a major component in
public policies worldwide to prevent child abuse and protect children’s wellbeing.

More needs to be done in this era of society complexity and global chaos. Community
groups need to play a part, and parents should also voice their desire for governments
to provide the kind of support that will help them become responsible and loving
parents who can keep their children safe, nurtured and thriving.



6.6 Getting in Touch with Our Inner Child

Sigmund Freud, the Austrian neurologist and psychologist who developed the
psychoanalytical approach to understanding people with psychological and mental
issues in the 1900s (Freud & Rank, 2012), proposed that the psyche comprised
three parts: Id, Ego and Super-ego. The Id is the unconscious, impulsive, childlike
part of our mind; the Ego is the conscious part; and the Super-ego is the moral
conscience, which curbs our self-indulgence and keeps us from making mindless
decisions. Building on this theory, the German psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl
Jung focused on the Id and developed his concept of ‘the Divine Child’ (Jung &
Kerenyi, 1963/1949). This Divine Child is part of our psyche—the unconscious
part of us that is the source of our enthusiasm for life and the foundation of our
sense of wellbeing, joy, peace and zest for adventure. It represents hope, transforma-
tions and new beginnings. It also serves as a connection between our conscious and
unconscious minds.
   Successive scholars in the psychoanalysis school have further developed Jung’s
concept of the Divine Child. The theory of the inner child, described by Firman and
Russel (1994), is a phenomenon of our life journey that includes our past, hidden lived
experiences—those that we are unconscious of. Some of these experiences might
have been harmful to us, such as childhood abuse, neglect or abandonment. When
these hurts are suppressed, they can lead to unconscious self-sabotaging behaviour
or mental health issues in adulthood. Kohut (1984) described the inner child as a
connection to the strains and pains of our lives not being acknowledged. Stern (1985)
states that the inner child can be considered the inner core of a person, which we carry
through our lifespan, including both strengths and weaknesses. Cullberg-Weston
(2009) explains that when we develop an understanding of how our childhoods
contribute to our adult lives, we are able to create happier and healthier lives for
ourselves. And Siegel (2015) maintains that people need to be seen, heard, and
understood by other people, and when this need is not recognised in childhood, it
is harder to establish the interpersonal connections and sense of belonging that are
essential to our mental and social wellbeing. Childhood trauma and the absence of
a sense of acceptance leave scars. This hurt inner child does not go away unless we
recognise it and heal it.
   While some of us have an inner child that is angry, insecure, vulnerable, or riddled
with guilt or shame, others have an inner child that never grows up. This means that
when an adult is stressed or hurt, they tend to resort to childhood behaviours like
throwing tantrums, crying, sulking and sneering. Some may crave attention and
appear overly emotionally needy. Others, especially those who did not grow up with
132                                                    6 Parent–Child Relationships and EI

loving parents or have many play opportunities when young, and so never got to
experience the joy of play and fun, may not know how to have fun. As adults, they
can become very serious, lack a sense of humour, and be critical of those who are
playful and spirited.
   Psychologists and therapists working on inner-child healing propose that in addi-
tion to an inner child, we all have an inner adult who is the same chronological age
that we are. This is the ‘inner voice’ that we sometimes hear when we are experi-
encing challenges or self-doubt, saying ‘You can do it, give it a go, don’t be scared’,
or ‘Don’t do it, you will make a fool of yourself!’.
   In the last three decades, some therapists have contributed further to theory on
healing the inner child. For example, Whitfield (1987) discovered through working
with his patients that childhood deprivation of love and recognition haunts us in our
adulthood, and that it is important to identify these hidden hurts in order to address
the issue as an adult, and leave that hurt child behind in order to a new life of hope
and positive advancement. Capacchione (1991) shared her experience of helping her
patients to heal their inner child through art therapy and journaling. She argued that
we can become our own ‘inner-parent’ in order to nurture the needy part of our inner
child and set it free. Parks (1994) provided strategies to help other therapists and
professional practitioners ‘rescue the inner child’.
   Finally, Paul (1992) indicates that adults who grew up with a wounded inner
child live with ongoing inner conflicts, and that it is important for these individuals
to become their own inner-parent and develop a bond with the hurt inner child.
By nurturing and addressing these childhood wounds, the individual can learn to
reduce negative and destructive feelings of shame, powerlessness, addiction, lack of
self-worth and withdrawal from relationships.
   Here is a summary of Paul’s six-step approach to creating inner bonding (1992):
1.    Be willing to feel pain, to make a conscious decision to change, and to take
      responsibility for your feelings.
2.    Move into the intent to learn. In order to build a genuine inner bond with yourself,
      you must embrace all feelings uncovered and not try to avoid or protect yourself.
3.    Dialogue with your wounded self and core self. By making dialogues (guided
      by your therapist) with yourself, you can identify the roots of fear, pain, guilt
      or shame and release the suppressed anger and pain stored in the wounded self.
      Then explore with the core self what would bring joy and happiness.
4.    Dialogue with your higher guidance. This refers to your spirituality (which is
      not necessarily related to religion or faiths). By throwing questions out into the
      open and allowing answers to come to you naturally, through art, music, words,
      you may be inspired to resolve some problems of the past.
5.    Take loving action. Learn to develop gratitude for all that you have and be
      thankful for the opportunity to learn, the people who support you, and the
      materials and assets that you have.
6.    Evaluate your action. By going through the previous steps over and over, you
      will discover whether healing has occurred and discover the truth and actions
6.6 Getting in Touch with Our Inner Child                                         133

     that bring a sense of peace. When this happens, you know you have established
     an inner bond with yourself.
   EI involves self-awareness. Having an awareness of how our childhood impacts
our present self is vital for our mental and social health. Today, the use of inner
child therapy is common in helping individuals to address their mental health and
relationship issues and develop their EI.



6.7 Parenting and EI

To be emotionally intelligent parents, we must first understand our own emotions,
feelings and moods. We must be honest in how we express our emotions and under-
stand that the way we do so affects our children. When we pay attention to our
communication styles and habits, we can begin to realise how our use of language,
word choice and tone of voice carry positive or negative messages to our children.
   Likewise, by understanding how our childhood attachment styles affect our
behaviour and connections to our family members, we can work to improve our
responsiveness to our children and form healthy connections with them. Knowing
about the different aspects of child development will keep us informed of our chil-
dren’s needs at different ages. We can also identify the unmet childhood needs that
prevent us from being more loving and nurturing parents. It is never too late to make
changes and repair broken relationships with our children, our parents, and other
family members.
   Empathy is key to any relationship. When we truly understand what empathy
means, we can be more open-minded, non-judgemental and accepting of the gener-
ational differences between us, our children and our parents. Using empathy and
compassion as our core guides, we can learn to adjust our parenting styles to meet
the developmental and emotional needs of our children, and help them to develop
empathy and compassion too.
   Parents who had difficult childhoods themselves may need professional help to
heal. They must be honest about their emotional struggles and identify their under-
lying causes. Learning to both seek and accept help is a challenge in itself—we live
in a hostile world, and many people are selfish and judgemental, and hold distorted
views of others who are different from them. For that reason, we need to voice support
for a more compassionate government that cares more about its people than profits
and economic growth. We need communities to come together to help those in need
and give them support. And we need more people to study sociology and psychology
to gain the professional knowledge and skills needed to help our fellow citizens!
   Parenting is both a bliss and a challenge. There is no such thing as the perfect
parent. We are all both good parents and bad parents at different times, and we can
only do our best. I hope that this chapter has inspired more parents to become aware
of their strengths, needed strengths, and limitations, and to take actions to improve
their parenting skills and enjoy parenthood.

Sibling Relationships and EI




7.1 Introduction

Sibling relationships are the most enduring relationships in our lives. We share our
family genes, our family names and heritage, and large parts of our life histories with
our siblings—especially our childhoods. We are in each other’s stories of good times
and challenges. We share and fight for our parents’ love and attention, compete for
praise, glory, and achievement, and help one another to weather tough times. There
are consistent findings in the literature that sibling relationships impact childhood
development, including cognitive, psychosocial, behavioural, language and interper-
sonal skills. Elements such as age, gender, age spacing, parenting styles and family
context all contribute to the quality of sibling relationships.
   This chapter discusses how sibling relationships impact the different stages of our
lives, explains the intricate positives and negatives of sibling rivalry and the signifi-
cance of sibling support in different family contexts, and how parents can influence
the quality of sibling relationships. It will help readers to acknowledge and manage
their feelings about their relationships with their siblings, and develop increased EI
so that they can enhance, rebuild, and consolidate supportive relationships with them.



7.2 Sibling Relationships and Our Psychosocial
    Development

Not everyone is blessed with a sibling, but a majority of us grow up with at least
one brother or sister. In the USA, nearly 80% of youngsters below the age of 18
live with at least one sibling (USCB, 2019). Having a sibling certainly does spice
up our lives! Sibling relations are defined by intimacy, strong, uninhibited emotions,
intimate knowledge of one another, and a huge range of personality differences.
Siblings know how to push our buttons, but they also know how to come to our

defence, to love and protect us, and make us feel better when we are hurt. They are
our first friends and playmates, with whom we learn to share, to fight and to forgive.
    As early peers, siblings play an exceptional role in our lives, presenting continuous
opportunities for social interaction. Sibling relationships are thus instrumental in the
development of social skills throughout our childhood and early adolescence. Soci-
ology research has shown that sibling interaction enhances the opportunity to develop
social skills and perspective taking—that is, understanding another’s thoughts and
feelings (Perner et al., 1994; Whiteman et al., 2016). Due to affectionate bonding,
younger siblings tend to look up to their older siblings as role models, which has
an influential impact on their social and behavioural development. Older siblings
also learn from their younger siblings through observation and routine interactions
(Brody, 1985).
    Interactions with older siblings promotes children’s language and cognitive devel-
opment, as well as their understanding of others’ emotions. Studies of child develop-
ment illustrate that while children with siblings are more verbally expressive, children
with no siblings appear to be more self-centred, have a lower level of behavioural and
social skills, and are less cooperative compared to those who have siblings. Siblings
provide one another with reciprocal development opportunities through routine and
ongoing interaction, and have a powerful influence on each other’s social-emotional
development (Azmitia & Hesser, 1993; Cameron et al., 2013; McHale et al., 2012).
    Children learn from their siblings how to communicate with other children and
form friendships, cooperate with peers, initiate play, give compliments and interact
with others, giving them a repertoire of social skills. These interactions boost their
self-esteem and social confidence, which also affects their academic achievement.
As children enter kindergarten and primary school, their social interactions become
more complex. Having an older sibling at school helps the younger one to adjust
and adapt to the new environment more easily (Berk, 2008; Bolnick, 2008; Downey
et al., 2015).
    Evidence over the last two decades has shown that sibling support also improves
academic achievement in childhood. Children who receive intimacy and warmth from
their sibling/s are more likely to cherish their support and appreciate their advice,
which leads to increased motivation to learn and achieve at school (Alfaro et al.,
2009). Students who took part in a study by Milevsky and Levitt (2005) reported
that they valued their siblings’ support in making academic adjustments, helping with
their homework and studies, helping them feel better when things bothered them, and
spending time together and doing fun things together. In sports, studies have found
that younger siblings look upon their older siblings as role models, and sometimes
as rivals, and tend to outperform their older siblings (Whiteman et al., 2016). High-
quality positive sibling relationships characterised by warmth, closeness and trust
have been shown to have a positive impact on children’s psychological adjustment
and social competence (Buist et al., 2013; Dirks et al., 2015).
    Siblings look to one another for mutual support in times of stress—especially
family stress when inter-parental conflicts are frequent. Studies have found that
having positive sibling relationships helps children who are frequently exposed to
parental disharmony to buffer each other from stressful family conflicts and minimise
7.2 Sibling Relationships and Our Psychosocial Development                         141

symptoms of anxiety and reduce emotional and behavioural problems, compared to
children without positive sibling relationships. It reduces signs of insecurity and
lowers levels of emotional reactivity and anxiety (Bush & Ehrenberg, 2003; Hank &
Steinbach, 2018).
    On the flip side of the coin, however, younger siblings can also use older siblings
as role models when it comes to risky behaviours such as smoking and alcohol
consumption (Whiteman et al., 2016). And as children grow into adolescents,
sibling relationships may change. An older sibling who was once a role model for
healthy social development may backflip into an antisocial influence. Many studies
have documented how younger siblings can follow a brother or sister’s choice of
behaviour across many domains, from smoking, drinking and risky sexual behaviour
to substance abuse and other antisocial conduct (Craine et al., 2009; Fagan & Najman,
2005; Kim et al., 2007; McHale et al., 2009).



7.2.1 Sibling Relationships in Childhood and Adolescence

Siblings are a fundamental part of most children’s social worlds during childhood. In
one study, McHale and Crouter (1996) found that children still spent over 30% of their
time with their siblings in their mid-childhood, compared to 23% with their mothers,
19% with their fathers, 13% with friends and 12% alone, showing that sibling inter-
action is still the most valued of all interactions at that point. However, as children
grow into adolescents, sibling relationships undergo some degree of developmental
transformation. Their need to develop their own identity and independence steers
them to become less emotionally engaged with their parents and siblings, and more
involved in the wider social world of friends and romantic partners. A decline in
both positive and negative interactions between siblings is observed in many cases,
and this includes intensity of sibling conflicts, quarrels, competition and issues of
power and status (Tucker et al., 2003). In many cases, siblings who were regarded
as friends and playmates in early childhood swiftly become peers with whom young
teens can share secrets and personal information that they do not want to share with
their parents. Many adolescents come to value their siblings as peers they can rely on
and trust to help them deal with problems, and prefer to seek their sibling’s advice
rather than their parents’ over personal matters (Lempers & Clark-Lempers, 1992).
   No sibling relationship is either totally positive or totally negative, blazingly
problem-ridden or brilliantly conflict-free. Nonetheless, perceptions of parental
favouritism, unfair treatment of different children and parental rejection can be
linked to aggressive behaviour and negative sibling relationships, which increase
from childhood to adolescence. Aggressive, conflict-driven sibling relationships, if
not handled properly, can lead to antisocial behaviour and personal adjustment prob-
lems, and even mental health issues during adolescence (Golombok, 2000). However,
some scholars argue that a degree of sibling conflict during adolescence can also help
individuals develop conflict management skills, learn to adopt different viewpoints
and learn to respect and accept differences. They believe that dealing with sibling
142                                                        7 Sibling Relationships and EI

conflict helps to facilitate a deeper understanding of the self and others, and is an
integral part of identity formation and the development of social maturity (Solmeyer
et al., 2014; Van Volkom, 2006).
    Older siblings can be a unique source of explicit imitation, vicarious learning and
reinforcement for a range of behaviours both good and bad. Admiration for older
siblings can sometimes lead a younger sibling down a less ideal path to harmful
behaviours such as drug use, alcohol consumption, vandalism, theft, and other misde-
meanours. However, some empirical studies found that family characteristics are also
likely to influence siblings’ choices of antisocial behaviour and delinquency. Family
characteristics such as disharmony and aggression, parental violence, parent–child
hostility and negative communication styles, family mental health issues, parental
criminality and family financial status all contribute to siblings engaging in nega-
tive choices and antisocial behaviour (Craine et al., 2009; Fagan & Najman, 2005;
Hank & Steinbach, 2018; Kim et al., 2007).



7.3 Family Dynamics and Sibling Relationships

Parental input in establishing positive and healthy sibling relationships will provide
benefits for a lifetime, as early relationship conflict is associated with poor devel-
opmental outcomes psychologically, mentally and socially. Today, with changing
family structures, not all children live in a ‘traditional’ family unit with their birth
parents. Some may live with step-parents, some with foster parents, single parents,
same-sex parents, or grandparents. Instead of, or in addition to, birth siblings, some
may also have half siblings, step-siblings, or foster siblings. No matter what types
of sibling relationships they have, however, quality bonding and connections will
enhance the wellbeing of all members of the family.
   Unfortunate life events such as divorce, family trauma, sudden job loss or deaths
happen sometimes. These changes to parent–child relationships are also associated
with changes in sibling relationships. Often, siblings turn to one another for support
when family circumstances are difficult, but parents who are able to maintain quality
parent–child relationships with their own children and with children after such life
events, including in new marital relationships or partnerships (which is often a huge
challenge in itself) can help the whole family to adjust to its new structure and build
a supportive unit.



7.3.1 Family Context

Family structures have undergone substantial changes in the last few decades. There
is no longer a ‘standard family’, as the concept of ‘family’ has become more fluid.
And research informs us that despite changes to their family lives, many children
7.3 Family Dynamics and Sibling Relationships                                          143

of divorced parents, for example, quickly adjust to their new family without expe-
riencing a great deal of psychological harm (O’Connor et al., 2000). Indeed, some
actually benefit from new family arrangements because of reduced parental conflict
or exposure to abusive acts by the adults in their lives. It has also been noted that
children with close sibling relationships adjust more easily to new family arrange-
ments than those who do not get along with their siblings (Dunn, 2004; Emery, 1999).
While there is evidence that much of the stress and agony encountered by children
during parent separation and divorce decline as time passes, however, there are also
some studies that report some of these effects persisting into adulthood (Kennedy
et al., 2008).



7.3.2 Birth Order and Sibling Relationships

Psychologists believe that the birth order of children in a family has an impact both
on them individually and on their sibling relationships (Dunn, 2004; Emery, 1999).
The birth order theory developed by Alfred Adler (1956) states that the order in
which a child is born affects their personality development. Adler (1956) also claims
that every individual has a self-perceived place in the family related to the order of
their birth.
    A firstborn child is usually raised with immense affection and a mixture of instinct
and lots of trial and error. Parents are likely to view their firstborn as a role model for
younger siblings, and they are given both more responsibilities, and at the same time
more privileges. Firstborns tend to identify closely with their parents, and to mirror
their parents’ beliefs and attitudes. Many choose to spend more of their time with
adults, and are considered reliable, conscientious, cautious, structured and high-
achieving due to parental expectations. Some can also be controlling and power-
seeking, as they like to be seen as the leader of the pack.
    Middle siblings (second-born, third-born, etc.) tend to think that they have to
work hard to gain parental attention, as this always seems to go to the firstborn
and/or younger siblings instead. As a result, they are either more agreeable or more
rebellious. The former know how to negotiate, be diplomatic and compromise, and
the latter may try to gain attention through misbehaviour such as temper tantrums or
getting into trouble. Middle children often appear to be more independent and self-
reliant than their siblings. They learn how to handle disappointment and develop
resilience. Many of them turn to other family members (e.g., grandparents) for atten-
tion and affection, and gravitate towards friends and peers for support. Middle chil-
dren who do not receive sufficient parental attention may grow up with an inferiority
complex and a need to grab the attention of those in their social world.
    Youngest children are often seen by their siblings as pampered and sometimes
even spoilt. Having had the experience of raising two or three children, parents often
allow their youngest child more freedom to be who they are without the pressure of
expectations. This is why the youngest child in a family tends to be more carefree,
easygoing, sociable and fun-loving than their older siblings. They may also appear
144                                                        7 Sibling Relationships and EI

smarter, as they learn from their older siblings and can avoid repeating their mistakes.
On the flip side, the youngest may sometimes be bullied by older siblings, and
they may not get as much attention from their parents as their older siblings. Many
youngest-born siblings feel that their opinions are not valued in the family.
    While many subscribe to the belief that birth order affects personality devel-
opment and sibling relationships, some contemporary scholars have contested this
belief (Healey & Ellis, 2007; Rodgers et al., 2000). Naturally, human development is
influenced by a complex of factors including relationship dynamics, interactions, and
environmental, cultural, and family contextual factors. However, when we are aware
of how the concept of birth order affects our behaviour as siblings or as parents, we
can be more mindful of the way we communicate, share and give support to both our
own siblings and our children, to ensure that they receive the emotional support and
parental nurturing they need.



7.3.3 Parental Emotional Maturity and Its Impact on Sibling
      Relationships

It is well documented that families headed by emotionally balanced parents are able
to provide their children with strong family bonds, a comforting sense of belonging
and security, good communication skills and healthy connections to others outside
the family. On the other hand, parents with low EI, and especially those who are self-
centred and emotionally immature, are more likely to neglect the emotional needs
of their children, undermine their confidence and self-esteem, and leave them with
emotional scars that will continue to hurt them as they grow into adulthood. Parents
low on EI also tend to be so preoccupied with their own worries and problems that
they are not able to give their children the safety, consistency, and unconditional love
they need. As a result, these children may feel unloved, stressed, and anxious, and
have low self-esteem (McHale et al., 2009; Mullan & Higgins, 2014).
    Parents who have grown up in traditional cultures that demand conformity carry
this baggage with them as they become parents themselves. They continue this gener-
ational placement of unrealistic expectations on children to ‘keep up the family
image’ and ‘honour the family name’. This does not mean that they are less loving,
but that they love in a way that can be harmful to the emotional and mental develop-
ment of their children. These parents are usually very controlling and expect obedi-
ence, diligence and submission from their children. They expect their children to
serve the ideology of the family.
    Such parents, many of whom are victims themselves of their parents and culture,
often unconsciously assign one of the following roles to their children (Alford, 1998;
Potter & Williams, 1991):
1.    The Golden Child: The high-achiever, usually in academics, art, music or sport.
      They are the pride of their parents who enjoy showing off the child’s achievement
      and talents. When a Golden Child is able to meet their parents’ expectations,
7.3 Family Dynamics and Sibling Relationships                                          145

     they are showered with love, praises, material rewards and power over their
     siblings. However, there is a lot of pressure on the Golden Child because they
     always have to be perfectly well-behaved and continuously perform to please
     their parents. These children are more likely to become egotistical individuals
     themselves and place the same pressure on their own children when they become
     parents.
2.   The Scapegoat: The one who gets the blame most of the time, not only from
     their parents but also from siblings and other members of the family. A Scape-
     goat may be a less conforming child who refuses to obey and has a different
     personality from their siblings, or a rebel who appears to be ‘misbehaving’ all the
     time, or a ‘failure’ who cannot meet their parents’ demands for high academic
     performance and other unrealistic goals. They are often blamed and shamed for
     not meeting family expectations.
3.   The Lost Child: The one who is ‘invisible’, especially amongst other siblings
     in a large family. The parents may be so obsessed with the Golden Child or
     so busy unloading their guilt and stress on the Scapegoat that the Lost Child
     gets forgotten and seldom receives any parental support or attention. This child
     may be introverted and prefer to spend time alone, shying away from family
     conflict. They may also have difficulties with communication and have a hard
     time forming relationships.
4.   The Caretaker: The one who is most likely to take on responsibility for looking
     after other siblings and doing house chores with their parents, or assuming a
     parental role if the parents are too busy (or too selfish) to pay attention to all the
     children. When there are financial struggles in a family, the Caretaker will often
     take a part-time job at a young age to help support the family. They are usually a
     more emotionally mature member of the family, who has a selfless personality
     and is giving and loving. However, as they grow into adulthood, they may feel
     resentful at the loss of opportunities to develop themselves, or have difficulty
     saying ‘no’ to unreasonable demands.
5.   The Mascot or Family Clown: The one who lightens the mood when there is
     tension between family members. They may be physically charming or witty
     and funny. Their role is to facilitate denial or minimise real problems that the
     family is not ready to face. The Mascot is skilled at lifting tension during a
     heated argument; however, these problems may not be solved because of their
     intervention, and can surface again. The Mascot may have difficulty facing
     reality and solving emotional problems, and may choose to live in denial when
     they reach adulthood.
6.   The Martyr: The one who knows how to capitalise on other family members’
     guilt to get what they want. They are opportunistic and skilled in guilt-tripping
     others to make them feel that they owe the Martyr for any favour they have done.
     Martyrs often blame others for their emotional discomforts, physical illnesses,
     crushed dreams and lost opportunities, even into adulthood.
These descriptions of the different roles children can play in the family to live up to
their parents’ expectations are theoretical portrayals based on assumptions made by
146                                                         7 Sibling Relationships and EI

social researchers. Many of us tend to associate ourselves or people we know with
character traits we read about, for example in horoscopes or personality tests: “Oh,
this would be my sister…that would be my cousin Jill…” But it is much better to look
at your family relationships in context and with clarity, and not to try to stereotype
yourself, your siblings, or your children using these descriptions and labels. If you
are a parent, however, you can use these descriptions to think about what expectations
you have of your children and how you treat them, and whether that has the potential
to steer them into any of these roles.



7.3.4 Sibling Conflict and Rivalry

Sibling conflict exists in nearly every family. Some parents think that sibling rivalry is
normal and not a concern. Developmental studies argue that through sibling conflict,
children learn to deal with jealousy, envy and competition, and that this is good
for their social and emotional growth (Edward, 2013; Fosco et al., 2012). Sibling
rivalry can teach children how to share and compromise, solve problems through
communication, and develop self-regulation skills which they will carry forward
into adulthood. Social scholars also believe that through conflict, children learn about
their own and others’ emotional reactions and expressions, and develop emotional
regulation skills (Halligan et al., 2014; Solmeyer et al., 2014; Volling, 2012).
   Sibling rivalry comes in many forms: a toddler rejecting a newborn and showing
regressive behaviour to gain attention, a fight over a toy, disagreements over small
matters, verbal expressions of anger and jealousy, silent competition for parental
and familial recognition, or emotional manipulation such as undermining a sibling
by spreading rumours, gossiping about them and excluding them from friendship
groups and family activities. However, some studies have found that children engaged
in healthy sibling rivalry also often express warmth and love towards their siblings
(Buist & Vermande, 2014; Tucker et al., 2013).
   There is a clear distinction between healthy sibling rivalry and sibling aggres-
sion. Finkelhor et al. (2006) state that developmental immaturity and everyday close
contact that causes friction are factors contributing to sibling aggression. In child-
hood, acts of physical aggression such as hitting, slapping, shoving and kicking are a
common part of sibling conflict, but without skillful parental mediation and teaching,
these aggressive acts can become habitual and turn ugly. Some may even develop into
violence and sibling abuse. Victims of such abuse often suffer both immediate and
long-term aftereffects linked to physical and mental illness (Button & Gealt, 2010).
Sibling aggression in childhood is also associated with later antisocial tendencies
such as bullying, substance use and academic problems (Solmeyer et al., 2014).
   Sadly, in many cultures across the globe, sibling violence and abuse are silently
condoned (Eshuys, 2008). These included biting, punching, kicking, and in some
extreme cases threatening or attacking with sticks, knives or other sharp objects.
Other forms of sibling violence found to be common in some East-Asian countries
included physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, abandonment and neglect
7.3 Family Dynamics and Sibling Relationships                                      147

(UNHRC, 2009; UNICEF, 2016; Weisner, 1993). Meyers (2017) claimed that sibling
violence is the most common type of family violence in the US, and advocated for
more attention to provide intervention and family education, and no longer regard it
as private family matters.
   Some scholars have found that differential treatment by parents is one of the
key causes of sibling conflict (McHale et al., 2012). Favouritism towards one
sibling, not only from parents but from other siblings and members of the extended
family, can also cause jealousy and lead to sibling rivalry. Other factors contributing
to sibling conflict include negative parent–child relationships, coercive parenting
styles, poor parental communication and parent aggression. Through observational
learning, children imitate their parents’ behaviour. Children with parents who are
constantly involved in marital conflicts have been found to be more aggressive in
their interactions with their siblings and other children (Meunier et al., 2012).
   The quality of sibling relationships depends on both the personal characteristics
of different siblings and the different family dynamics around them, such as parent-
parent relationships, parent–child relationships, child-child relationships, parenting
styles, family values and family socioeconomic status. When parents are aware of
the indirect influence they can have on their children’s relationships, they can learn
skills and strategies that will reduce tension amongst family members and foster a
more agreeable family environment. However, there are no silver bullets, as each
family is unique and so is every child.
   Not many of us get taught effective parenting skills. We all learn to deal with
our children’s problems based on how we were treated as children. However, EI
is about both self-awareness and other-awareness. Therefore, we need to start by
understanding ourselves, the ways we communicate and relate to our spouses and our
children, the way we solve problems and the way we express ourselves emotionally—
to both utilise our strengths and work on our needed strengths—to solve family
problems.



7.3.5 Parenting and Managing Sibling Relationships

Decades of research on parent–child relationships have proven that parenting styles
and parent influence have a significant impact on many different aspects of child
development, including sibling relationships (Biglan et al., 2012; Heckman, 2008;
Ross & Lazinski, 2014). Children who grow up in a safe, warm, and nurturing
environment are more likely to become responsible, caring, and well-balanced
socially, psychologically and emotionally. Parents who are more responsive than
demanding, are consistent in providing boundaries and are able to help their children
develop essential interpersonal and social skills significantly shapes children’s life-
long relationship-building capability (Sanders, 2012). Supportive and democratic
parenting is another factor that influences positive and healthy sibling relation-
ships, which are defined by strong bonds, low distress, and fewer sibling conflicts
(Gamble & Yu, 2014; Ross & Lazinski, 2014).
148                                                         7 Sibling Relationships and EI

    For generations, parents have struggled to find ways to solve the problem of
sibling rivalry. Some early studies specified that nearly 70% of parents indicated
a need for support in resolving conflictual behaviour among their children, but a
majority of them did not see themselves—their parenting and communication styles,
or differential treatment of their children—as the cause of the conflict. Still, many
researchers recognise that parent-based interventions as the most effective way to
help parents manage sibling conflicts, the key being to help them identify the strengths
and limitations of their parenting skills (Biglan et al., 2012).
    Research on sibling relationships and sibling conflicts is still scarce, as many still
regard such discords as a normal part of family life (Tucker et al., 2013). However,
there are some successful interventions and parent support programs documented
in the literature, which have been able to help both children and parents develop
communication and problem-solving skills, and encourage positive behaviour. One
such programs was the Fun with Brothers and Sisters program (FWSB) developed by
Kramer and Radey (1997). This comprised five 40-minute sessions where children
were taught social skills, play and friendship skills, perspective-taking, how to deal
with angry feelings and how to manage conflict. Positive results were reported,
including a decrease in rivalry, fewer problematic sibling behaviours and a reduced
power discrepancy between siblings.
    In 2008, Kennedy and Kramer extended this program and named it the More Fun
with Sisters and Brothers Program. This program used a sibling dyad approach rather
than a group approach. Siblings attended the sessions as interactive dyads at play
under ‘experimental conditions’. Through these simulations of conflict, the children
learned to control their negative emotions and refrain from reacting negatively to
each other. The results showed a decrease in conflict between the siblings after the
intervention.
    Another success story involved a group intervention named the Siblings Are
Special program (SIBS) in Pennsylvania, USA. The program involved parents and
children in mid-childhood (Grades 3–5), and provided 12 weeks of afterschool
sessions and three Family Nights where children and parents were taught skills and
attitudes that would lead to supportive and cooperative sibling relationships. Chil-
dren were also taught social skills, which helped them to not only develop better
relationships with their siblings, but also deal with conflicts with peers and class-
mates. Parents were also shown appropriate strategies to guide their children in the
development of self-control, social competence and academic competence. Pre- and
post-intervention assessments showed reductions in maternal depression and chil-
dren internalising problems, but a reduction of sibling conflict was not observed
(Feinberg et al., 2013).
    In contrast, Ross and Lazinski (2014) taught parents strategies to mediate their
children’s conflicts and demonstrated that when parents are given appropriate strate-
gies and guidance, they can reduce sibling conflict, and also create an improvement
in their children’s social skills. In addition to giving these parents skills and strate-
gies, successful parental support programs that taught parents to establish a warm,
responsive, consistent family environment have significantly shaped the behaviour of
both parents and children, resulting in positive outcomes. Rather than taking over and
7.3 Family Dynamics and Sibling Relationships                                        149

reprimanding the children during a conflict, parents were taught to be coaches and
help their children develop effective conflict resolution techniques that they would
otherwise not have learnt (Sanders, 2012).
   In Australia, a Positive Parenting Program, also known as the Triple P program,
was developed by the University of Queensland as part of a public health approach
to parenting support (Sanders, 2012). This comprehensive parenting support system
aims to supports infants, toddlers, preschool children, primary school children and
teenagers. There are a range of delivery modules targeting different groups with
different needs. The program incorporates five levels of intervention:
•   Level 1: Universal messages for all parents.
•   Level 2: Low intensity large group giving brief parenting advice.
•   Level 3: Topic-specific parent discussion groups and individual programs.
•   Level 4: Intensive groups and individual programs with focused parenting skills.
•   Level 5: Intensive family intervention for high-risk or vulnerable parents.
Within these different levels of intervention, parents learn skills and strategies to
improve their parenting skills and knowledge through discussion and sharing, and
by watching simulations of different challenges.
   Some of these activities include:
•   Setting ground rules.
•   Identifying common and specific problem behaviours.
•   Identifying reasons for fighting.
•   Teaching awareness of parent traps and helping parents to identify personal traps
    they fall into when handling sibling conflicts.
•   Teaching skills to teach children to play and interact cooperatively.
•   Teaching skills to encourage good behaviour.
•   Manage conflict by using directed discussion (i.e., asking the children what they
    should do and how they can practice doing the right thing).
•   Setting boundaries and giving constructive consequences.
•   Manage aggression (e.g., by using quiet time and time out).
Based on theories of social learning, the Triple P program helps parents to build posi-
tive parental skills by using assertive discipline and acting promptly when children
misbehave. It shows parents how to set realistic expectations for themselves and their
children. Over 290 trials and studies have been conducted by different scholars who
have applied the approach in many different cultures and family situations. It is one
of the more successful parenting programs aiming to help parents manage sibling
rivalry (Sanders, 2012).
   This section has illustrated that positive parenting is vital to helping children to
develop positive, loving relationships. Parents influence sibling relationships by the
way they relate to their marital partners and to their children, where they serve as role
models. A majority of parents need extra knowledge, skills and support to become
effective parents; to date, research on parental support of this kind is still scarce.
150                                                         7 Sibling Relationships and EI

7.4 Sibling Relationships in Unusual Circumstances

Parents of children with disability or chronic health condition face tremendous chal-
lenges and stress. Siblings of these children, too, experience a wide range of emotions
and stressors. The birth of a brother or sister with such additional needs can lead to
disrupted attachment to the parents, a change in family roles and an increased amount
of stress. Some children may feel jealousy and resentment of the sibling who requires
additional care and an inordinate amount of attention from their parents, feeling that
it comes at their expense. They may feel neglected because so much of their parents’
time and emotional energy is necessarily directed at the child with additional needs.
They may also resent any apparent preferential treatment their sibling receives and
develop a perception of parental favouritism (McHale et al., 2000; Suitor et al., 2009).
    Sometimes siblings are expected to help out with caring for a disabled or sick
child, or to take on extra household chores to relieve parental stress. While this may
help siblings feel valued and useful, it can also interfere with their social development
and their psychological growth and wellbeing. Research has found that some children
who are required to care for their siblings with additional needs can feel resentful,
and guilty about feeling resentful (Seligman & Darling, 1989; Strohm, 2002).
    Children with a sibling who has developmental delays may not have the same
opportunities to develop socially at home as other children. A sibling with additional
needs may not have sufficient skills to communicate with their brother or sister, be
an active playmate or be a role model. They may not be able to share imagination
games or dreams, or take on an equal role in companionship. They may also be
less responsive and less active in social and play interaction, making playtime more
difficult for both.
    In one study of children with siblings with additional needs, Ali and Sarullah
(2010) found that the majority had a positive outlook toward and felt acceptance of
their siblings with additional needs, but many also reported feelings of anger, guilt
and sadness mixed with their love, pride and empathy. Many siblings of children with
a disability or chronic illness also report feeling fear, guilt and shame: some fear that
they may ‘catch’ the same condition as the sibling with additional needs; some feel
a degree of ‘survivor’s guilt’ about being ‘the lucky ones’ who have good health
and freedom of movement; some, especially those who are teased and harassed by
ignorant people at school and in the community, feel shame (Strohm, 2002). Other
studies have reported that children who have a sibling with autism, in particular,
tend to be shyer and more reserved than those without (Inam et al., 2017), display
lower self-concept (Roberts et al., 2016), and are more likely to experience anxiety
and depression, resulting in a lower overall emotional wellbeing rating (Emerson &
Giallo, 2014). Some reported feeling embarrassed to be seen in public with their
sibling with disabilities and experiencing higher levels of stress due to an inability to
talk about their feelings regarding their relationships with their sibling with additional
needs (Loots & Pit-Ten Cate, 2000).
    Children or adolescents who are older than their siblings with disability may
also find themselves taking on a caregiving role if their parents fall physically or
7.4 Sibling Relationships in Unusual Circumstances                                    151

mentally ill, or if the family became overwhelmed by social or economic challenges
such as extreme poverty and lack of support. Likewise, single parents working long
hours who cannot afford childcare, incarcerated parents and parents with addiction
issues may need to enlist older siblings to look after the younger ones. For example,
one study in 1998 reported that over 50,000 children and adolescents in the UK
had undertaken a carer role in the family at the time (Dearden & Becker, 2000).
These roles included caring for a grandparent (38%), a sick parent (34%), siblings
(11%), or other relatives (9%). Another report on a cross-national survey carried out
in six European countries—Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland
and the UK—found that 28% of their respondents were young caregivers between
the ages of 5 and 17 (European Policy Brief, 2019). This report noted that 49% of
young caregivers spent a lot of time taking care of their family members, including
performing personal care tasks such as helping with bathing, dressing and feeding,
household tasks and meal preparations.
    Historically, children were seen as social capital—resources that families could
use to provide for the family in one way or another, including by earning an income
as child-labourers (Lee & Bulatao, 1983). Today, in some sociocultural contexts
such as Asian and Latin American cultures, children—especially older siblings—
are still considered essential supporters of the family (Kuperminc et al., 2009). In
such cultures, parents believe that giving a child the role of caregiver will help to
promote maturity, responsibility, and fundamental family goals and values (Weisner,
2001).
    A gender bias is also present in parents assigning children a caregiving role in the
family. The literature unanimously finds that girls are expected to take on a caregiver
role far more often than boys. Many young girls take on the role of baby-tender
or child carer because it is considered ‘natural’ for them to do so (East et al., 2009;
Zukow-Goldring, 2002). Some girls even declare that they value these roles and show
a desire to take on such responsibilities (Kroska, 2003).
    Studies that report positive outcomes for children caring for family members, espe-
cially younger siblings, claim that this role fosters a positive self-identity (Brubaker &
Wright, 2006), gives children a sense of purpose and responsibility (Burton, 2007),
and increases their perspective-taking and social understanding (Bryant, 1992).
However, many reports have also testified to the negative costs of children taking on
such roles. Some argue that excessive family labour can deprive children of their own
opportunities for social development, health, and mental wellbeing. Researchers have
also found that children or adolescents who take on a caregiving role in the family
for a prolonged period of time are more likely to experience depression (Shifren &
Kachorek, 2003), stress, poor academic performance (Dodson & Dickert, 2004), and
early sexual activity, particularly for teenaged girls (East & Jacobson, 2001). Some
may have poor self-esteem and feel worthless and unloved, while others feel angry
and pressured by the extra burdens placed on them (Aldridge & Becker, 1993; Earley
et al., 2007).
    These days, when parents talk about the juggling act involved in raising a family,
they mostly mean helping their children with their studies and taking them to soccer
and dancing, art class and ballet, on top of doing the grocery shopping and laundry
152                                                        7 Sibling Relationships and EI

and handling sibling rivalry. However, when there is a child with additional needs in
the family, parents have to deal with doctor’s visits, therapy visits and tending to the
personal needs of the sick child along with those of their other children. They have to
juggle attending to their children and taking care of their own needs, and handling the
emotional adjustments required for the whole family. No family can do this alone.
Those with a supportive extended family and friends who are willing to take up caring
for their child with special needs from time to time are the lucky ones. Others have to
rely on their older children. However, in some advanced countries, these families can
also get some help from the government. Over the past two decades, respite services
are provided in many advanced countries such as Australia, Canada, the US, the UK
and New Zealand, and some Asian and European countries, to provide temporary
care for children with disabilities and chronic illnesses, and for their parents and
family members too. Respite care is a service which provides care for the child with
additional needs, with specially trained carers, so that the family can have a short
break from taking care of the child (Meadan et al., 2010). There are also respite
camps available for siblings who need a break from caring for a brother or sister, so
that they can spend time with their peers. These respite camps give them time to rest,
relax, refresh, and recharge—and in doing so, also improve their caregiving capacity
(Doig et al., 2009; Merriman & Canavan, 2007).
   Empirical evidence has been found that respite care can have positive effects on
the mental health of siblings, improve the marital relationships of parents, and allow
parents to spend more time with their other children so that they do not feel neglected
(Hoffman et al., 2006; Langer et al., 2010; Welch et al., 2012). Chan and Sigafoos
(2001) also found that the more a family uses respite care, the lower the incidence
of family conflict.
   There are many families in need of this kind of social support. These include
children who bear the responsibility of caring for their parents or their siblings. If
governments are not able to provide sufficient support to meet the increasing demands
of today’s societal weights, it is up to us to take action and contribute to alleviating
the multidimensional pressures on these children. As teachers, fellow parents, and
community members, we can pool our resources, cooperate and form support groups
to help our fellow citizens, especially children.



7.5 Sibling Relationships in Adulthood

Sibling relationships change at different stages of our lives. It is common to see less
closeness amongst siblings as they transition to different stages in life, for example
when moving from adolescence to adulthood and gaining their own circles of friends,
starting a career, leaving the family home, and getting married and starting their own
families. During young adulthood, sibling relationships become a choice, as siblings
no longer have to live under the same roof. Those who have close bonds with their
siblings will likely continue to connect with one another and share warmth and
closeness, while those who did not get along in childhood may drift further apart.
7.5 Sibling Relationships in Adulthood                                                  153

    Emotional ties between adult siblings can be positive, negative or ambivalent.
Siblings who are intimate tend to consider each other good friends. Their bond is
based on loyalty and family allegiance in addition to personal experience. Siblings
who fail to connect tend to feel apathy and indifference towards one another. In
adulthood, communication tends to be a rare event, as they are neither emotion-
ally connected nor socially associated. They are friendly with each other at family
reunions but prefer to leave each other alone at other times. Siblings who are actively
hostile to each other are likely to have shared a history of intense negative sibling
rivalry since childhood. Their relationship is characterised with anger, resentment,
bitterness and avoidance.
    Studies on sibling closeness in adulthood have found that while the connections
between siblings may decline in young adulthood, when individuals are building
careers and families, there is a tendency for them to get closer again when one of
them has a child (Conger & Little, 2010). Likewise, a family crisis, the death of a
parent, unfortunate events, family hardships and challenges can also bring siblings
back together, as many feel an obligation to support one another and rebuild a family
bond (Fowler, 2009; Myers et al., 2001). Some studies have found that sisters are
more likely to maintain a warm relationships with their siblings than brothers and to
be more involved in initiating contacts either through telephone conversations or via
face-to-face meetings with their siblings (Voorpostel & Van Der Lippe, 2007). While
sister-sister dyads are more engaged in sharing emotions through talking and being
each other’s confidants, brother-brother dyads bond by engaging in activities such
as playing sports, having a drink with social groups, or playing chess or card games
(Floyd, 1996). However, there is no gender difference when siblings help each other
out by doing favours, helping in emergencies, and just being there to support one
another.
    Relational communication is dynamic. People with different personality traits
communicate differently. When one family member is less active in initiating commu-
nication with their siblings, it does not necessarily mean that the emotional bond
between them is weak, because people communicate through nonverbal as well as
verbal means. People also choose to communicate with their siblings for different
reasons. The motive of affection revolves around communicating in order to demon-
strate appreciation of and concern for others, while the motive of connection could be
to interact with others in order to reduce loneliness. People also connect and commu-
nicate with their siblings to share enjoyment and pleasure, excitement, and fun, such
as going on vacation together, engaging in adventurous endeavours or even going
into business together. Unfortunately, some also communicate with their siblings for
less pleasant reasons, such as to seek validation, to exert control, or to fulfil their need
to brag and gloat. Finally, many older adult siblings communicate to share comfort
and to reminisce about the ‘good old days’ together (Canary & Dainton, 2003).
    Parental influence can have a long-lasting impact on sibling relationships. The
perception of unequal treatment from parents can carry forward into adulthood and
still affect how some adults view their siblings and how they relate to each other
well into their lifespans. Such perceptions have been found to be associated with
154                                                          7 Sibling Relationships and EI

behavioural problems in childhood and adolescence, low self-esteem, negative judge-
ment, depressive symptoms, and risky or antisocial behaviour (Long et al., 2015).
They can also either facilitate or hinder the development of coping mechanisms for
interpersonal challenges and relational stress in later life, particularly for the siblings
who are not ‘favoured’ (Meunier et al., 2012).
    However, cultural influences also determine how parental differential treatment is
perceived. In some Asian cultures (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean), the eldest son
is recognised as the heir to the family’s inheritance and legacy. From childhood to
adulthood, he is given a broad range of support (emotional, social and financial) and
groomed to be the leader of the family. He may inherit a much larger portion of the
family wealth later in life, and receive respect and high esteem from all other family
members, including aunties and other female family members (Lu, 2007).
    But with privileges come obligations and responsibilities. The eldest son, whether
he is endowed with family wealth and fortune or the son of a working-class family,
is expected to repay the benefits gained from this ‘parental favouritism’ later on in
life. First and foremost, he has to look after his parents in their old age, in sickness
and in health—including paying for their living expenses, medical bills and other
financial obligations. At the same time, he is expected to handle problems faced
by younger siblings and support them, including helping them financially when
they are out of a job, helping to support them during family crises, and providing
other forms of emotional and financial support when required (Lu, 2007). In other
cultures, adult siblings often come into conflict over who should be the primary
caregiver for their elderly parents. Having to bear this responsibility alone can result
in resentment, strained relationships, and conflict among adult siblings. Feuds over
family inheritances can also be a devastating experience for adult siblings, leading
to relationship crises and even legal disputes.
    Although siblings may detach themselves from family relationships to establish
their own lives in young adulthood, there is a tendency for many to attempt to recon-
cile past differences and create stronger emotional bonds later on in life (Moyer,
1993). With age and life experience, communication patterns between siblings
change, and the quality of the relationship may change as well (Myers & Goodboy,
2010). Social scientists have identified several relationship maintenance behaviours
in older adults as part of their attempts to repair or strengthen sibling relation-
ships. These include: assurance, or indicating to their siblings their continual support
and connection; conflict management, or understanding and addressing conflict in a
more patient and mutually supporting way; positivity, or communicating in a posi-
tive manner; joint participation, or mutual engagement in family tasks and support;
mutual counselling and advice; and networking (Richmond et al., 2005). In general,
many older adults report that they are in regular contact with their siblings and share
a positive and supportive relationship with them. Earlier feelings of ambivalence,
conflict and parental favouritism in childhood and young adulthood no longer bother
them. There is also evidence to show that older people who enjoy harmonious sibling
relationships are less lonely, more joyful and enjoy better health (Van Volkom, 2006).
7.6 Sibling Relationships and EI                                                      155

7.6 Sibling Relationships and EI

Sibling relationships are enduring and play a vital role in shaping our wellbeing across
our lifespans. As illustrated in the sections above, there is substantial evidence to show
that the quality of our relationships with our siblings, both positive and negative, can
influence our psychosocial, behavioural and emotional wellbeing. Having healthy
sibling relationships and connections can generate a greater sense of happiness and
contentment, while stressful sibling relationships can compromise our health.
    EI is not only about being self-aware and understanding our emotions and how
they affect us at different times and situations, but also about strengthening our
ability to manage our strong emotions and remaining calm and composed in stressful
times, and using positive thoughts to facilitate our emotions and behaviour. It is
also about understanding other people’s emotions and strengthening our ability to
acknowledge and interpret their emotional signals and behaviour, and respond to
them in appropriate ways. Our siblings are one of the greatest sources of love and
support across our lifespan. Sadly, however, in some sibling relationships, there is
tension because of misunderstandings, different views and opinions, or unresolved
childhood resentments. Consequently, the siblings who were our first friends can
become strangers and even foes.
    When we focus on developing increased EI, we become more attuned to ourselves
and understand how emotions drive our behaviour and thoughts. We also become
more aware of others’ needs, and more understanding and accommodating of their
emotions and behaviours. We learn to develop more emotional intimacy with our
family members and will have a stronger desire to form close connections with
them, especially those from whom we have drifted apart.
    Change begins with the self. When we are more aware of our emotional strengths
and utilise them to enrich our relationships, the whole family will notice the change.
This might lead to positive changes in them too. When we have identified our need to
develop more emotional strength, our behaviour will change, and this will improve
the way we communicate and connect with others. Remember that consistency builds
trust. Practise your new skills consistently, and remember that change takes time.
    As parents, we need to be mindful of how we treat our children and make sure we
appreciate them for who they are. Some are talented at academics, some at sports,
art, or music. Some are outgoing, while some are quiet. Some are compliant and
people-pleasing while others may have a more defiant and rebellious nature. It is
more easily said than done, but when parents are fair and loving, they can reduce
sibling rivalry and promote a more loving and happy family.
    And if our childhood memories are tainted with sibling aggression and conflict,
perhaps we can consider replacing them with more pleasant ones in order to reconnect
with the siblings who were once our friends? Rebuilding and repairing a relationship
is a challenging and time-consuming process. The desire to reconnect with your
siblings may need to be facilitated by other family members to make it a reality, or
in some cases, by a professional therapist. The process of letting go of the pain and

anger of childhood sibling conflicts will set you free from other related mental issues
too. The key is forgiveness.
   The scope of EI is wide and covers different aspects of intrapersonal and interper-
sonal relationships. It takes time, practice and dedication to increase one’s EI, and to
harness this intelligence to facilitate healthy and valuable relationships with others.
Every relationship is as unique as the individual in it. It is my hope that you can
use this chapter to gain a deeper understanding of the complexity of sibling relation-
ships, and pursue skills and strategies to enrich your relationship with your siblings
or provide more insightful parenting approaches to enhance the sibling relationships
of your children.

Friendships and Romantic Relationships




8.1 Introduction

We all have friends; we all need friends. Friendship can increase our sense of
belonging, boost our happiness, and offer us companionship. Children make friends
easily, while teens are more selective, and as we get older, some adults find it harder to
meet and make friends and may drift apart from their old friends too. Developing and
maintaining friendships requires effort, time, and social-emotional intelligence. This
chapter provides research-based data on how friendship impacts us at different stages
of our lives—in childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. It also discusses
how friendship has changed in this digital era. It then moves on from friendship to
discuss romance and love relationships for young people, and highlights the chal-
lenges people with disability face in navigating their social worlds, and in forming
friendships and love relationships.



8.2 Friendships at Different Stages of Our Lives

Friends enrich our lives and give us support in many different ways. They share
our thoughts and interests, help us in times of need, and make us feel valued and
appreciated. Some people keep the same friends from childhood through to old age,
and these lifelong buddies may be more valuable to them then their family. Others
form different friendships at different stages of their lives. However, some people
have difficulty forming or maintaining friendships. The following may give some
insight into the different aspects of friendships, and inspire you to become more self-
aware of your strengths and needed strengths in maintaining healthy friendships—or
help your family members, friends, or students to develop more meaningful social
relationships too.

8.2.1 Childhood Friendship

Friendships give children a sense of belonging, acceptance, and security, and help
them to develop important life skills and social-interpersonal skills. Through friend-
ships, children are able to learn more about themselves and develop their own iden-
tities. While playing and interacting with their friends, they also learn to understand
and accept others’ viewpoints, to recognise and copy age-appropriate behaviour, and
to learn about rules by observing their friends and having conversations.
    Studies have revealed that the nature of childhood friendships changes at different
developmental stages. For example, Sullivan (1953) claimed that there is a distinction
between friends, schoolmates, and playmates for young children. From preschool age
to ages 6–8, friends are just playmates, but from ages 9–12, children understand the
concept of friendship better and begin to form a closer relationships with their friends.
From ages 13 to 22, young people look for emotional connection in their friendships.
Damon and Hart (1988) also observed that ‘friends’ equates to ‘playmates’ in early
childhood, as many children are still rather self-focused at this age. Later, in mid-
childhood, a strong sense of trust and loyalty becomes important, and children expect
and desire friends whom they can count on for support in times of difficulty. In early
adolescence, they develop closer and more intimate relationships with their friends.
Trust and loyalty become stronger elements in adolescent friendship.
    Bigelow and LaGaipa (1975) described childhood friendships as having three
stages:
1.    The reward-cost stage: This refers to easy access and availability (e.g., neigh-
      bours and classmates), and those who can provide them with interesting toys
      and share activities that they mutually enjoy.
2.    The normative stage: At this stage, children aged around 10–11 want to make
      friends with others who share the same values as them, and those that they can
      trust. They are also more conscious of rules and fairness in games and social
      interactions.
3.    The empathetic stage: As children get older (ages 11–13), they form emotional
      connections with their friends and disclose personal information to one another.
In preschool, children play with everyone. They are not very conscious of gender
difference. As children enter primary school, however, they tend to congregate around
friends of the same sex. While most girls favour gentle games, sometimes involving
dolls and soft toys, boys tend to prefer more active games which involve intense
physical motions, like running, climbing and ball games. However, there are also
boys who enjoy playing with dolls and girls who love running about kicking a ball or
sweating it out in physically strenuous activities, and gender difference in friendship
groups is less obvious these days than it was in the past.
    Some children make friends naturally and move easily between different friend-
ship groups. Some may have problems making and maintaining friendships, and need
help from adults to teach them social and friendship skills. This is particularly true
for children who are shy or have a quiet nature. Such children sometimes respond
8.2 Friendships at Different Stages of Our Lives                                      165

to peer conflict with fear, and prefer to be by themselves. Other children, especially
those with special needs conditions (e.g., ADHD, aggressive behaviour disorder and
other disabilities) will need to be taught specific skills to help them form and maintain
friendships. This will require the input of parents, teachers, and trained professionals
(Gonzales, 2020).
    In the past, children with friendship problems were blamed for both their
behaviours and their personalities. As parents and teachers, however, it is our respon-
sibility to help children and support their need for friendship. By understanding the
reasons behind the challenges they face, we can provide assistance so that they can
connect with their peers. Positive parental input, for example, is vital to build the
self-esteem and self-confidence children require to make friends. Letting the children
know that their parents and teachers are there to talk to them and help them with their
problems can be a source of comfort for children who are lonely. Enrolling them in
team sports or group activities can also help to teach them the necessary social skills
and emotional intelligence, language pragmatics and communication skills to form
friendships too.
    Children with poor social and interpersonal skills are more likely to be aggressive
when they are involved in a conflict. Many may still be emotionally immature and
less conscious of how their behaviour affects others. When rejected, they may resort
to name-calling or teasing, or even become physically aggressive. Some may try to
boss people around, while others may whine or complain excessively because they
do not know how to handle disagreement or tensions among group members. And
some may overreact when losing a game, and become angry or despondent.
    Children with good social skills are likely to have parents with good social skills as
role models (Hamner & Turner, 2001). By observing the way their parents interact
with others and how they communicate, these children learn how to relate to and
connect with people in a positive way. In some Asian cultures, for example, social and
interpersonal skills are part of a child’s personal development or character education
curriculum. Most Asian children are taught from a young age how to take turns,
respect other people’s personal space, play fair, behave well when winning or losing
a game, and apologise when they have offended others. These days, EI is part of the
school curriculum in many countries.



8.2.2 Teen Friendship

Friendships are an important aspect of a teenager’s life. Adolescent friendships are
a key part of forming one’s sense of identity, self-validation, and emotional security.
Supportive friendships can increase a teenager’s positive self-concept, self-worth and
emotional stability, and form a protective mechanism supporting the development of
resilience. At this stage of development, most teens turn to their friends for support
in times of stress and challenge. The ability to both seek and accept help is an
essential part of building resilience. It helps to strengthen the bond between friends
and promotes the development of compassion, trust, and empathy.
166                                             8 Friendships and Romantic Relationships

    Peer networks based on both school friends and out-of-school friends are promi-
nent features of a teenager’s social world, and an important influence on them as
they develop autonomy and social adjustments. By developing different friendship
groups, young people can learn to do new things that they do not do with their family
members. They can exchange information about how puberty affects them physi-
cally and emotionally—things that they may feel more comfortable discussing with
friends of their own age than with parents or teachers. They can also feel more able
to talk about their fears or desires when befriending a person that they are attracted to
in the pursuit of a romantic relationship. They can discuss, argue about and learn to
understand different values, ideas and viewpoints. They can talk about their dreams,
their futures, and share knowledge and expertise with their mates.
    Teenagers know that the quality of their friendships is important. Friendship
quality refers to the satisfaction each partner gains from a relationship (Aboud &
Mendelson, 1996). While positive friendship quality can act as a buffer against
stressors and minimise the extent to which they internalise problem behaviour, low
friendship quality can lead to social isolation and increase externalising behaviours in
teenagers (Thompson et al., 2006; Waldrip et al., 2008). Adolescents who experience
low friendship quality are also more likely to find themselves subjected to victimisa-
tion, harassment and teasing within their friendship group, or with individual friends.
This can impact their social adjustment and even affect their academic performance
(Underwood, 2002).
    Numerous scholars have surveyed and interviewed different sets of teenagers
and found similarities in what they describe as positive friendship quality. Features
of positive friendships include intimacy, loyalty, attachment, companionship, close-
ness, validation, mutual disclosure, help and guidance, conflict resolution and mutual
support (Allen et al., 2005; Burkowski et al., 1994). A gender difference has also been
observed. Teenage girls tend to report that they value intimacy, companionship and
self-disclosure more than boys, and are more exclusive in their friendships (Simpkins
et al., 2006). However, both sexes choose friends who share the same interests and
values, such as academic priorities, sports, music, art, fashion (Knecht et al., 2010).
    Adolescents are easily influenced by their friends, both in positive ways and in
ways that may lead them down antisocial paths in the long run. For decades, truancy
and underage drinking have been two of the major adolescent problems found in
Western countries like the UK, Europe, USA and Australia (Atkinson et al., 2012;
Wachtel & Staniford, 2010). Students play truant from school for many different
reasons. These may relate to family problems, self-esteem issues, lack of a sense of
belonging and acceptance, victimisation, poor teacher-student relationships, or low
academic performance. However, some also choose to skip class because their mates
do, and some just see it as an exciting risk-behaviour and want to experience some
unstructured, unmonitored time doing ‘cool’ stuff with their friends. Some of these
activities could be perfectly innocent, like going to a friend’s home to play online
games or hanging around the shopping mall, but others might involve gratifying
their curiosity by try smoking, drinking, or even taking drugs. Henry and Thornberry
(2010) found that increased truancy behaviour and unsupervised time spent with
8.2 Friendships at Different Stages of Our Lives                                     167

peers is more likely to lead to adolescent alcohol and substance abuse amongst high
school students.
    Studies have also found strong links between peer influence and adolescent binge
drinking (Engels et al., 1999), which can eventually lead to alcoholism in adulthood
(Burk et al., 2011). Alcohol consumption is an intrinsic part of Western culture, and
plays a significant role in most people’s social lives, from weddings and funerals
to sports events and even just winding down after a day’s work. In Australia, for
example, alcohol is the most used drug throughout society, and causes a range of
health issues, including being one of the leading causes of death for young people
(AIHW, 2020). Teenagers engage in risk-taking behaviour connected to alcohol out
of a desire to blend in, and as a status-seeking pursuit to gain recognition amongst
their friend groups. Even when a teen knows better, they may lack the skills needed
to resist peer pressure or avoid being teased, mocked or isolated by their peers.
    Peer pressure is defined generally in social psychology literature as a direct influ-
ence on someone to act in the way their peers or friends want them to. The pressure
to conform is hard to resist, especially for younger teens aged 13 to 16 and many
people, especially children and adolescents, feel that they must do what their friends
do to be accepted. Many follow trends created by youth culture, such as fashion or
music, or get involved in daring, high-risk activities (e.g., roof planking, agile dance
moves). Studies have found that adolescents who are most easily swayed by peer
pressure are those with low self-esteem, those who have a strong need to be liked
and accepted, and those who identify strongly with their ethnic or cultural groups.
Adolescents who also have problems in the family, feel unloved or are troubled by
parental conflicts or family disharmony, and have a great fear for rejection and a
strong need to belong to a group or a community, are particularly at risk. In contrast,
teens who have high self-esteem, self-confidence, social skills and interpersonal
skills, and have strong connections with their family are found to be less vulnerable
to peer pressure (Bongardt et al., 2015; Brown, 1982).
    Peer pressure can be good as well as bad. When young people are influenced
by positive peer pressure, they will improve in their mental health, social lives and
decision-making. Positive peer pressure can be seen in action when a teenager is
encouraged, or even pushed, to make a positive choice, such as giving up bad habits
and forming new ones by spending less time on video games and more time on
schoolwork, or giving up junk food and exercising more, or being more honest and
responsible. In contrast, negative peer pressure can influence a young person to do
things that might be harmful or even dangerous, from smoking, drinking, and taking
drugs to shoplifting, car-stealing and joyriding, and other criminal activities (Wong
et al., 2016).
    When children and young teens are taught social skills and given coaching to
raise their EI, they tend to be more able to make good choices and decisions for
themselves, and to walk away from peer pressure. When they understand their own
emotional and social needs, values and beliefs, they can develop a stronger sense
of self. However, many young people, especially those with family problems, need
intentional teaching and EI coaching to strengthen their personal and social develop-
ment. Parents and teachers therefore need to develop better knowledge and skills to
168                                             8 Friendships and Romantic Relationships

help students overcome the challenges they face in their friendships and interpersonal
relationships. Educators and curriculum planners need to consider strengthening EI
training at school, rather than just focusing on academic results and test scores.



8.2.3 Adult Friendship

What does friendship mean to adults? The importance of friendship has been deliber-
ated since the beginning of civilisation. The great Chinese philosopher and teacher,
Confucius (551 BCE), considered friendship to be a relationship from which one
could derive trust and the joy of benevolence. Roman scholar Cicero (106 BCE)
described two types of friendships: friendship based on virtue, and friendship based
on mutual support and self-benefit. And the eminent Greek philosopher, Aristotle
(384 BCE), described three types of friendship: (1) perfect friendship, that provides
qualities of virtuousness that mutually benefit both parties; (2) friendship of plea-
sure; and (3) friendship of utility, that provides help and support (Blieszner & Adams,
1992).
   Contemporary scholars describe friendship as a voluntary relationship that people
form to gain mutual support, intimacy, and self-validation (e.g., Birditt & Antonucci,
2007; Demir et al., 2015), and as ‘the social glue to paste over networked lives’
(Vernon, 2005, pp. 1–2). Lynch (2015) presents two views on friendship: a non-
instrumental perspective that involves genuine care and concern for a friend, and
an instrumental perspective that involves getting together to seek pleasure, achieve
desirable outcomes, and carry out acts of mutual benefit. Demir et al. (2015) have
found that affective bonds between friends are a central source of joy which create
mental strength and good moods. Argyle (2001) claims that friendships provide us
with companionship to share laughter and cheerfulness and generate enjoyment.
These scholars believe that we further develop our own identity through our friends
thanks to the enrichment we gain from sharing our thoughts and experiences with
them.
   Friendships differ from other relationships. Sutcliffe et al. (2012) identify three
types of relationships: (1) family members and loved ones, including spouses and
close friends; (2) relationships based on family ties, e.g., in-laws and cousins; and (3)
acquaintances, or people we do not share deep affection with, e.g., neighbours and
work colleagues. Ajrouch et al. (2001) found that 70% of people valued family rela-
tionships over friendships, while Cheung et al. (2015) identified that adults tended
to turn to family members for support in time of stress rather than to their friends,
and also preferred to spend more time with family members than with friends. Many
scholars believe that relationships with family are naturally strong and do not require
frequent contact, though frequency of contact will affect the maintenance of a friend-
ship. Family relationships are also more interdependent, and family members play
unique roles in our lives that impact us from different perspectives (Fuller-Iglesias
et al., 2015). Social researchers have also found that most people include family
members as ‘friends’ in their social networks. In fact, family members constitute a
8.2 Friendships at Different Stages of Our Lives                                    169

larger percentage of most individuals’ social networks than friends do (e.g. Acock &
Hurlbert, 1993; Roberts et al., 2009).
    What distinguishes friendships from family relationship is that friendship is volun-
tary: people can choose their friends in a way they cannot choose their siblings,
cousins, uncles and aunts. They can drop their friends when they choose to, or grow
apart from them naturally without continual contact, as friendships are ‘less regu-
lated by social norms and easier to dissolve’ (Miller, 2009, p. 208). Friendships also
mandate fewer obligations than family relationships, and do not require the deep
commitment, passion, and investment of time that romantic relationships do. On the
other hand, people tend to have fewer antagonistic and hostile exchanges with friends
than with family members!
    Some think that close friendship can buffer people against issues with their spouses
(Argyle, 2001; Fuller-Iglesias et al., 2015), while others think that individuals can
benefit from multiple friendships as they can serve different functions and provide
different sources of satisfaction and wellbeing that spouses and lovers, and other
family members, cannot (Gillespie et al., 2014; Walen & Lachman, 2000). Some
scholars have found that friends can provide more positivity and understanding,
and that people tend to turn to friends for support that they might not get from
their spouses or partners for this reason. Such connections appear to increase the
individual’s personal wellbeing, sense of security, and happiness (Cheung et al.,
2015).
    Through the lens of the Attachment Theory, some social practitioners tell us
that for most adults, their attachment figures are their romantic partners and their
best (or closest) friends (Birditt & Antonucci, 2007). In many cases, people who
are married also refer to their spouse or partner as their ‘best friend’ (La Guardia
et al., 2000). People describe best friendships as having qualities such as intimacy,
closeness, acting in each other’s best interest, being emotionally supportive of each
other, exhibiting caring, concern and understanding, and being able to act as mirrors
of each other without judgement, criticism, or conflict (Demir et al., 2015). When
couples share intimacy as well as close friendship with each other as a result of
sharing life experiences, challenges, successes and disappointments, they are able
to maintain a continuous connection that influences their thoughts, feelings and
behaviour, resulting in a unique and lasting bond (Antonucci et al., 2004). Such a
loving relationship and friendship can be the greatest blessings of a person’s life.
    Research informs us that men and women often have different outlooks on friend-
ships. They may share the same level of happiness and wellbeing with their friends,
but in general, they differ in the quality of their emotional experiences and friend-
ship expectations. For example, Biehle and Mickelson (2012) found that men tend
to think they are more satisfied with their marriages than women and to invest more
time into their marriage than into forming new friendships. Likewise, Demir et al.
(2015) found that men are more likely to be content with a satisfying romantic rela-
tionship, while women need both a romantic relationship and intimate friendships
for their wellbeing. Tschann (1988) also discovered that married men are less likely
to disclose intimate information to their friends than unmarried men, and that men
encountered more qualitative declines in friendship after marriage than women.
170                                             8 Friendships and Romantic Relationships

   In contrast, Demir et al. (2015) found that women value emotional closeness,
self-disclosure and conversational support in friendships more than men do. They
are more drawn to satisfy their sense of belonging and to support their self-esteem
through friendships, and therefore, many women have larger social networks than
their husbands or boyfriends (Pietromonaco & Perry-Jenkins, 2014). Many women
stated that their friendships were as important to them as their marital relationships,
while those who were experiencing marital problems thought friendships with other
women were more vital to them than their relationships with their husbands (Argyle,
2001).
   Age also affects how couples connect socially with their friends. Finkel and
colleagues (2014) found that younger couples have larger networks of friends with
whom they interact regularly. However, as they become parents, the demands of
parenthood begin to constrain their ability to bond socially with their friends, and
they start to spend more time with family members such as parents and siblings who
can provide them with resources and advice on looking after their children.



8.2.4 Friendships in Older Adulthood

As we get older, we also change how we make friends and maintain our friendships.
In an earlier study, Matthews (1986) discovered three distinctive friendship styles
in older adults, noting that discerning individuals prefer to interact with only a few
close friends, while more independent older adults abstain from close friendships,
and those with more extraverted and outgoing personalities continue to make friends
throughout their lifespan. In a later study, Miche et al. (2013) confirmed these friend-
ship styles, and added that friendship style also varied based on socioeconomic status,
gender, health, and individual characteristics. For example, people from different
socioeconomic spheres have different standards of behaviour and expectations of
friendships, and they tend to congregate in groups with similar ethnic or cultural
backgrounds, or levels of economic resources.
    Adams and Blieszner (1994) found that friendships among older adults are influ-
enced by three factors: cognitive, affective and behavioural. Some older people value
quality over quantity when it comes to friendship. They choose their friends via a
cognitive process and evaluate their friendships based on similarity, personal char-
acter, shared experiences and even attractiveness. Some choose their friends via an
affective process, based on their emotional reactions towards others. They look for
friends who show empathy, trust, affection commitment, joy and other pleasurable
emotions. Those who choose friends via a behavioural process look for people with
whom they can communicate and share thoughts and feelings, people who display
affection, social support, and accommodation of a friend’s desires, and people who
share similar interests and likings. Muraco (2012) found that in general, older adults
regard respect, trust, loyalty, tolerance, consideration, affection, commitment, and
self-disclosure as norms for friendship.
8.2 Friendships at Different Stages of Our Lives                                    171

    In a German study, Hahmann (2013) found that older adults who are widowed
tend to position their friends or adult children as substitutes for their lost partners.
They value everyday care-related routines, like morning phone calls and friendly
visits for a cup of tea or to provide some assistance with household needs. For some,
even just a caring phone call will make their day. This is especially noted amongst
those with declining health. Some even turn to their carers or domestic helpers for
friendship. Bouwman et al. (2017) also found that more and more older adults are
turning to social media and online friendships to alleviate loneliness. In Europe,
there are friendship enrichment programs to help older people maintain or build new
friendships, which could help to prevent mental health issues caused by loneliness.
    Reciprocal positive friendships are essential for optimal wellbeing. They are built
on trust and acceptance, are mutually supportive, have healthy boundaries and chal-
lenge us to grow. People with caring and supportive friends experience higher levels
of wellbeing and better mental health, are more optimistic, have fun and enjoy life
more. Friendships, in other words, are significantly linked with both physical and
mental good health.



8.3 Friendships in the Digital World

Digital technology has changed how we form and maintain friendships, and how
we communicate and share information with our friends. Social media helps us to
nurture and expand our relationships with our friends, work colleagues and family
by providing a platform that breaks down spatial and temporal constraints. Today,
we do not need to make expensive long-distance calls to get in touch with our loved
ones and friends overseas. We can send a message to a friend in the middle of the
night and get a response the next morning! In the old days, when we moved to live in
another state or country, we had to cut our social ties with our buddies. Today, digital
technology offers us a way to extend our friendships even across long-distances.
   Rawlins (1992) identifies three types of friendships: active, dormant, and
commemorative.
1.   Active friendships: these are relationships with existing friends, with whom
     we connect frequently and provide with emotional and other support.
2.   Dormant friendships: these are friendships we developed earlier in our lives.
     We may still keep in touch with them from time to time, but due to spatial-
     temporal constraints (e.g., friends who have moved to other places), it is not
     possible to keep in touch as much as we would prefer.
3.   Commemorative friendships: these are friendships we formed long ago, e.g.,
     a childhood friend or high school buddy, but that have drifted apart and that we
     probably do not expect to become active again, though the people involved may
     still be fond of each other.
172                                            8 Friendships and Romantic Relationships

With social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Linked-in and
countless others, we can now reconnect with our friends of all types and reinvigorate
friendships that have lapsed over time.
    Facebook was created by Mark Zuckerberg to help people to connect with friends,
especially those who feel socially anxious or too shy to approach others to estab-
lish a meaningful friendship (Kirkpatrick, 2010). Through social media, people can
choose a range of social activities with which to connect with others, such as discus-
sion boards, online games, instant messages and voice chat. This has opened many
doors for lonely or timid people who might feel awkward about communicating with
others in face-to-face situations. Journalist Rosenwald states that social networks,
‘particularly Facebook, are for shy people what water is for the thirsty’ (2011, p. 1).
    Recent studies have confirmed that the opportunity for people, especially young
ones, to communicate with others on Instagram has reduced social isolation. Li et al.
(2018) observed that young people found new opportunities for self-expression and
self-acceptance through posting photos and self-disclosing information on Insta-
gram, especially when they received affirmatory responses. Other studies have also
confirmed that social platforms which allow young people to share photos and videos
have increased self-esteem and decreased social isolation amongst young people
(McMillan & Morrison, 2006; Stapleton et al., 2017).
    Digital technology is changing what friendship means for all of us, young and old.
We are all learning to navigate new friendship norms and unconventional friendship
dynamics. In a more recent research study by the UK Safer Internet Centre (2018),
the following data reveal how young people (aged 8–17) viewed digital friendships:
• The most popular platforms used by young people aged 8–17 on a daily basis
  were YouTube (41%), WhatsApp (32%), Snapchat (29%), Instagram (27%) and
  Facebook (21%).
• Around 39% of the respondents reported they had made friends online that they
  would not have otherwise.
• Over half (54%) of the respondents claimed that they would feel isolated if they
  could not talk to their friends via digital devices.
• 73% said that it was important that their friends reply to their messages.
• 60% said that it was important to them to be included in group chats.
• 51% said that it was important that their friends ‘like’ their updates or posts.
• A majority (83%) of them thought that most of the people they connected with
  online were kind to them.
• 68% of them said that chatting to their friends online cheered them up.
• Connecting with their online friends make them happy (89%), excited (82%) and
  inspired (74%).
• Just under half (49%) reported having bad experiences online, which included
  people being mean to them, or excluding them.
• These bad experiences made them feel sad (56%), angry (52%), and worried or
  anxious (42%).
• Ways of dealing with these bad experiences included doing something else offline
  (65%), doing other enjoyable online activities (63%), talking to a parent or carer
8.3 Friendships in the Digital World                                                173

     (62%), talking to other friends (62%), or reporting the interaction/blocking the
     mean person (58%).
•    A majority (88%) said they had sent a kind message to a friend online who was
     feeling upset.
•    A majority (80%) said they had stood up for a friend who was being treated
     unkindly online.
•    Over three quarters (78%) said that that everybody on the Internet has a
     responsibility to be respectful.
•    Over three quarters (77%) said that they wanted their parents or carers to be there
     for them if they experienced negative treatment online.
•    Just under three quarters (72%) wanted their schools to teach them how to deal
     with cyberbullying and manage friendships online.
•    Over half (58%) felt that their teachers did not understand their online lives, but
     less than a third (28%) said that their parents did not.
•    One third (33%) said that they would not speak up when they had a negative online
     experience because they were scared of getting into trouble.
In a review of the impacts of social media on children and young people, Swist et al.,
(2015, pp. 5–6) identified eight spheres of influence:
1.    Physical and mental health: while most social media promote positive norms
      about health and wellbeing, at the same time, some introduce a range of risks,
      especially in the form of inaccurate information.
2.    Identity and belonging: well-meaning organisations can foster identity forma-
      tion in children and youth and promote community-building and creativities
      via social media, but at the same time, some sites can present upsetting and
      potentially harmful content which can have serious effects on wellbeing.
3.    Formal and informal learning: some websites support the self-directed
      learning and aspirations of marginalised young people, and extend formal and
      informal knowledge and social support for young people generally; however,
      poor integration of social media in formal and informal learning networks can
      also reinforce social exclusion.
4.    Play and recreation: many social platforms provide leisure, play and recre-
      ation spaces for children and young people; online video games in particular
      provide opportunities for learning, creativity, identity formation, socialisation,
      relaxation, and stress relief.
5.    Consumer practices: some media platforms can positively influence the
      consumption patterns of children and young people by facilitating supportive
      networks and attitudes to financial wellbeing and empowering young people’s
      consumer and financial literacy.
6.    Civic and political engagement: some media platforms are creating new spaces
      for young people’s civic and political engagement by opening up opportunities
      for diverse forms of participation and self-expression, and creative ways to
      address social issues. However, while only a small minority of young people
      are considered to be at risk of radicalisation, social media can also be used
174                                             8 Friendships and Romantic Relationships

      to circulate politically extremist messages which, in combination with other
      complex factors, can potentially lead to harmful practices.
7.    Risk and safety: social media can amplify risks to physical and emotional
      safety, but can also promote proactive approaches that empower children and
      young people, develop their resilience and support their wellbeing.
8.    Family and intergenerational relationships: some social media platforms
      support family and intergenerational relationships and utilise different forms
      of expertise—including the knowledge and skills of children and young people,
      their peers, their family members and other adults—to promote safety, wellbeing
      and resilience.
Just as many young people are actively connected through virtual socialisation, more
and more older adults are also connecting with their friends online. Gatto and Tak
(2008) disclosed that in 1996, only 2% of Americans aged 65 and older used the
Internet. This increased to 15% in 2000, and 22% in 2004. Zickhur and Madden
(2012) later found that 70% of adults in the USA use the Internet every day to connect
with their friends via email or stay in touch via other social media platforms. Today,
social media allows older adults in particular to maintain connections with friends
and family. This is especially helpful for those who live apart from their family
members, particularly if they can no longer drive, or have physical and cognitive
limitations that prevent them from enjoying face-to-face connections with others
such as meeting a friend for a cup of tea or having a beer at the pub. Wright (2000)
observed that social media had led to an increase in social inclusion and wellbeing for
older adults, lowering the stress caused by loneliness, and improving life satisfaction.
More and more community services globally are providing computer and Internet
skills programs to equip older adults to use digital technology to seek out different
forms of self-entertainment, from watching a movie on YouTube or listening to
concerts online, to playing bridge or card games online and connecting with other
people who share the same interests, with whom some might eventually become
online friends.



8.4 Friendship and Relationship Conflicts

Friendship is a very important part of our psychosocial development from childhood
right through to old age. However, we all have both a good-natured side, and a dark
side that we can fail to recognise. While many of us may think we are kind, sensible,
caring, and responsible individuals, we may have a blind spot to flaws such as vanity,
selfishness, vengefulness and envy. Some of us may be aggressive by nature and not
realise that we are pushing our friends, especially the very gentle and accommodating
ones, to a point where they feel uncomfortable or hurt. In the old days, especially
for Baby Boomers, teasing, misogynistic and bigoted comments, uninvited personal
contact, and racist and sexist slurs were all part of a ‘friendly’ social exchange, with
8.4 Friendship and Relationship Conflicts                                          175

those telling the ‘jokes’ not realising, or not caring, how hurtful it was to be on the
receiving end.
   Runde and Flanagan (2010, p. 19) identified a list of traits that may be harmful
to our friendships and interpersonal relationships. This list can help us to reflect on
our own behaviour, or recognise the behaviours of our friends and understand why
and how they make us feel uncomfortable. The traits are:
• Abrasiveness: being arrogant, sarcastic, and demeaning.
• Aloofness: being isolated, not seeking input, and hard to approach.
• Hostility: being angry, frequently yelling and losing their temper.
• Micro-management: constantly monitoring and checking on others.
• Being overly analytical: focusing on minor issues, perfectionistic.
• Self-centredness: caring only about the self, believing they are always correct.
• Lack of appreciativeness: failing to give credit, seldom praising good perfor-
  mance.
• Unreliability: missing deadlines, unable to be counted on.
• Untrustworthiness: exploiting others, taking undeserved credit.
In an earlier study, Samter and Cupach (1998) also unearthed a number of causes of
friendship conflicts and tensions, giving insights into how a relationship may become
problematic. They include:
• Rival relationships: When a third person comes between two close friends and
  takes away the time and attention of one friend.
• Disapproval of relationship choices: When one friend dislikes or does not feel
  comfortable with the other friend’s association with an individual or group of
  friends who do not share the same values, or behave in ways that they perceive to
  be unacceptable.
• Disagreement about ideas: When one friend strongly disagrees with another
  about anything from political views to cultural issues, or fashion trends and
  celebrities.
• Sharing activities: When one friend frequently has to accommodate the other
  in the choice of leisure activities (e.g., choice of movie, sports activities, travel
  destinations, etc.) and there is no reciprocity.
• Friendship rule violations: When a friend fails to fulfil an obligation, or is
  constantly unreliable, dishonest, or irresponsible.
• Sharing space and possessions: When two friends share a living space and there
  are frequent disputes about the sharing of space and utilities, and even food.
• Relationship intimacy: When one friend (whether platonic or romantically
  involved) becomes jealous of the other becoming too friendly with others outside
  the friendship. Tension may also arise when one party fails to show as much
  intimacy as expected in the relationship.
• Misunderstanding and communication breakdowns: When there is miscom-
  munication between friends, or confusion due to other situational or relational
  reasons. Misunderstandings are common in every relationship.
176                                            8 Friendships and Romantic Relationships

Earlier studies on competition amongst friends pointed out that humans need a certain
measure of both similarity to and differentiation from others. We share closeness
with our friends because of our similarities, yet we also crave distinctiveness, which
sparks a desire (conscious or unconscious) to compete with them (Fromkin, 1972).
A long history of studies of friendship competition and social comparison has found
that individuals’ attitudes, personal qualities, and social-cultural influences drive
competitive behaviours amongst friends and associates. As children, many of us are
taught to do well and excel, and also to do better than others: for example, in Western
cultures, some middle-class families will acquire the latest household utilities to
keep up with the Joneses, wear Prada or Gucci fashions to demonstrate their taste
for luxury goods, and spent thousands on Mercedes or Porsche to demonstrate their
wealth and status. Likewise, Asian parents will make endless sacrifices to get their
children into elitist schools, then boast about their children’s academic achievements
and keep count of whose sons become doctors and lawyers, and whose daughters
marry rich and reputable husbands.
   Wood (1989) argues that people engage in this kind of social comparison for three
reasons: self-evaluation, self-improvement, and self-enhancement.
• Self-evaluation: this is the tendency to compare yourself to somebody who is
  similar to you, and measure them against your own personal standards, in order
  to gain a sense of self and of your own abilities. The outcome of the comparison
  will drive future performance.
• Self-improvement: this is the tendency to compare yourself to somebody who is
  doing better, such as an idol or a celebrity, so as to push oneself to a higher level
  of performance, state of health, lifestyle, appearance, weight loss goal, or social
  and wealth status. This is called upward comparison.
• Self-enhancement: This is the tendency to compare yourself to others who are
  not doing as well. Known as downward comparison, this gives the individual a
  mental boost by telling them that they are doing better than others, which protects
  their self-esteem, strengthens their self-confidence, and improves their motivation
  to continue toward their goal attainment.
Today, lots of people both young and old make use of social media and Internet
platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.) to connect with friends and
sometimes strangers. It has become a trend to post photos and videos of travel and
trips, weddings and birthdays, baby achievements, and personal achievements—
both to share our joys and perhaps to boast a little. These photos and videos are
placed online with different intentions. It can be to communicate with friends and
family—to give them an update on family lives or personal growth—or it can be to
fulfil a need to socially compare. Some postings may be accurate; some are grossly
exaggerated. Research in the last decade has found that sharing personal information
via digital posting of photos or videos can have positive outcomes, such as increasing
self-esteem and receiving social support, and encouraging more social disclosure for
individuals who otherwise are too shy or reluctant to share personal information in
face-to-face situations (Best et al., 2014). But at the same time, some scholars have
found that many people, especially adolescents, develop depressive symptoms when
8.4 Friendship and Relationship Conflicts                                              177

they compare themselves with their ‘fortunate’ friends who are successful, high-
achieving, popular, and happy. Some even develop jealousy towards their friends
and resent their ‘oversharing’ (e.g. Chou & Edge, 2012; Kross et al., 2013).
    People are competitive for a multitude of reasons. It can be part of their personality,
insecurity, arrogance, or the need to prove superiority. It can be a perceived need to
measure up to their friends’ expectations in order to gain acceptance or approval.
Whatever the reason, there are many different ways to respond to overly competitive
friends. First of all, make sure you are not throwing stones while living in a glass
house. It is easy to see other’s flaws, and not so easy to see your own! So self-
awareness is important. Try to understand why this friend wants to compete with you,
and why you are responding negatively toward their apparent competitive behaviour.
Could it be your own bias, driven by envy? The first step is to make the person aware
of this behaviour, in a tactful way, if possible. Give praise and approval where they
are due and be as supportive a friend as you can. If you do not want to listen to
more bragging, change the subject, and refuse to give negative reinforcement that
encourages further bragging or competitive behaviour. Seek help and advice from
others, or read about how to develop skills to handle friendship competition and
jealousy. And remember, you cannot change others. You can only change yourself.



8.5 Young Love and Romantic Relationships

Changes in our physical and cognitive development as we move into adolescence
bring about transformations in our relationships with our family and friends. Adoles-
cence is marked by the desire to gain more independence and a shift away from
parental control to self-reliance and autonomy. Social interactions and friendships
therefore become a stronger focus for a developing teen. Following years of study
and observation of adolescent development, Spano (2004) has identified three stages
of transformation:
1.   Early adolescence: At about age 11–14, children begin to experience dramatic
     physical, mental and emotional changes. While they are still very attached to
     their parents, they begin to turn to friends and peers for emotional and social
     support. Many become sensitive about their physical appearance and how they
     are judged by others. Some begin to take an interest in the opposite sex and
     desire a romantic relationship. However, most remain in friendship groups or
     have individual friendship dyads.
2.   Mid-adolescence: This falls between ages 15 and 16, and is a short but fast-
     changing period. In their process of gaining independence, some may experience
     more parent-teen conflicts and turn more to their friends for new attachment
     figures from whom they can gain emotional support. While many struggle to
     understand what their hormones and physical changes are doing to them, some
     experience strong sexual urges and have intense yearnings to experience love
     and sexual relationships. However, many of these initial relationships are also
178                                             8 Friendships and Romantic Relationships

      short-lived and superficial, because these teenagers have not yet gained the
      maturity they need to appreciate what a loving relationship is about.
3.    Late adolescence: At around age 17–21, a young person begins to mature
      and gain a firmer sense of their own identity. Consequently, they become more
      thoughtful about their actions and long-term goals. Physical attractiveness is
      a substantial influence on their self-esteem. They also seek commitment in
      relationships and have a clear sense of what they want in a romantic partnership.
Social scholars have observed a pattern in the transformation of social relationships
amongst teens. Pre-teens move from a same-gender group to a mixed-gender group
as they reach mid-adolescence. Most teenagers engage in affiliative activities, e.g.
going to parties and on social outings, in a group context. Then they begin to ‘date’
someone from within that group, and finally, they begin to form dyadic romantic
relationships. It has also been observed that those who are regarded as ‘popular’ tend
to date more than the rest of the group (Connolly et al., 2004; Furman & Hand, 2006).
In an earlier study, Carver et al. (2003) similarly reported that 36% of 13-year-olds,
53% of 15-year olds, and 70% of 17-year-olds in their study claimed that they were
involved in a ‘romantic relationship’.
   Collins (2003) defines a romantic relationship as a connection shared between two
people with a distinctive intensity of affection and a desire for sexual behaviour. This
connection is also marked by the duration of the relationship, the frequency of dating,
how the people in the dyad spend time together and what they do, and the cogni-
tive processes (perceptions and self- and other-attributions) and emotional processes
(feelings and moods) associated with the relationship. Connolly and Konarski (1994)
explain that romantic experiences foster the development of a sense of identity in
teenagers. In growing from childhood to adolescence, they have formed different self-
schemas of themselves with their general peer group, their close friends and their
romantic partners. Adolescents who have experienced positive romantic experiences
may think of themselves as attractive and appealing, which increases their self-
confidence and self-esteem, while those who have been through negative romantic
experiences may have lower self-regard. Furman and Shaffer (2003) believe that
romantic relationships can also have an impact on an adolescent’s identity and sense
of sexuality, their transformation of family and peer relationships, their scholastic
achievements, and their career planning.
   Romantic love is associated with a strong feeling of attraction to, fixation on, and
fascination with someone. It is accompanied by a fast pounding heart, a feeling of
euphoria, and also anxiety. This feeling, called infatuation, gives people an uncon-
trollable, passionate, obsessive desire to be with the special person, even to the point
of becoming totally consumed by the thought of this person. However, many still
debate whether infatuation is really love, especially when it happens to young teens.
Some social scholars argue that infatuation fades over time once the intensity of
the initial magic of physiological and psychological arousal diminishes (Langeslag
et al., 2013). When infatuation is strongly associated with sexual desire, it may be
called ‘lust’ and in time, one or both parties will find out that their relationship is
8.5 Young Love and Romantic Relationships                                            179

only fuelled by sexual attraction and their desire for sex and physical connection.
However, love can also grow from the initial passionate feelings of infatuation.
    Love requires compassion, a genuine care for the other person, the desire to under-
stand them, a degree of common interests, and an attachment or a special bond with
that person. It requires personal maturity, interpersonal skills and communication
skills. In a recent conversation with some friends, I collected some anecdotal data
on how they described the romantic relationships they had in their late teens. Ronny
described himself as a rather manipulative ladies’ man. He had several romantic
relationships going on at the same time, and whilst he enjoyed the company of these
women, he was distracted from his studies and failed to get into university. Larry
told me he had a very demanding girlfriend who was very fashion conscious. On the
plus side, Larry improved his dress sense but he also spent a fortune on unnecessary
clothing and accessories to please his girlfriend. He soon realised that this superfi-
ciality was not part of a genuine relationship and was glad that he met his current,
very down-to-earth wife a few years later! Eve stated that she suffered body-image
issues because all of the men she went out with adored slender women. She was
always hungry and unhappy trying to please these men. Eve commented that her
behaviour was a sign of lack of self-respect and self-confidence.
    Nathan talked about his struggles with his first girlfriend at age 18. He described
her as a ‘spoilt princess’ who had a tendency to blow small issues out of proportion.
He was glad that they eventually broke up. Nancy reported that she experienced an
abusive relationship with her first boyfriend. He was very controlling and verbally
abusive, but she was in love with him and could not separate from him. It took her a
long time, and a lot of care and support from her family, to break off that relationship.
However, it also taught her what to look for in a relationship, and now she is very
happily married.
    Nancy’s story is not unusual. Any young people, both male and female, experience
abusive treatment from their partners in their romantic relationships. Murphy (2020)
reports that nearly 1.5 million high school students in the US experience dating abuse
each year, including emotional, verbal and physical abuse. Only 33% of these teens
tell their parents or another adult about it. However, 81% of American parents believe
that teen dating violence is not an issue, or admit that they do not know if it is an
issue. Many of these abusive behaviours are not recognised by the person on the
receiving end (the victim), partly because of a lack of life experience, and partly
because some believe that it is normal or feel too ‘in love’ to challenge being treated
badly. The most common abusive behaviours described in the literature include:
• using disrespectful language (swear words, put-down language, bigotry).
• extreme jealousy or insecurity.
• explosive outbursts of temper.
• mood swings (using their moods to control the partner).
• extreme possessiveness (constantly checking the partner’s calls, social media
  activities).
• dictating the partner’s social activities (who they can and cannot see or connect
  with).
180                                             8 Friendships and Romantic Relationships

• displaying a very domineering behaviour (telling the partner what to do or wear).
• psychological abuse (verbal aggression, threats, insults, humiliation).
• physical abuse (slapping, pushing, throwing a drink at someone’s face, and other
  forms of hitting and kicking).
Studies have shown that dating abuse and violence amongst young people are preva-
lent across cultures and nations, and that they seriously affect the mental health of
these youngsters (Halpern et al., 2001; Silverman et al., 2004; Tabachnick, 2009).
Schools in many developed countries across the globe have put in place child and
youth protection policies and relationship education packages to educate high school
students about respect and relationships, and to teach young people how to recognise
the warning signs of abusive behaviours, what to do and how to handle dangerous
situations, and how friends and bystanders can take action to help a victim.
    Our early experiences in romantic relationships can have ramifications for later
love relationships in our adult lives. Parental support is essential to help young teens
navigate their social and romantical landscapes as they learn and develop through
these relational experiences.



8.6 Young Love and Romantic Relationships for People
    with Disabilities

Young people with disabilities are no different from any other adolescents. They
have the same need for love and friendship as all of us. The only difference is that
they face more challenges during their journey of growing up and establishing a self-
identity. Despite generations of changes and societal evolution, attitudinal barriers in
the form of stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination still exist today. The centuries-
old medical model that portrays people with disabilities as ‘sick and needed to be
fixed’ still endures, as is demonstrated by the attitude of the general public globally.
Although the social model of empowering people with disabilities through social and
educational inclusion has been advocated for and endorsed by governments across
the globe for nearly half a century, its influence is as yet ineffective and its impact
minimal.
    Social science literature that studies love and marriage amongst people with
disabilities remains scarce. Amongst them, Tepper (2000) reported that persons with
disability in general face hurdles in finding romance or intimate relationships because
of the common myth that people with physical disability are asexual. Miller et al.
(2009) also found that a key reason for the challenges faced by individuals with
disabilities is that a disabled body may not be aesthetically appealing. A few studies
have detected that women with disabilities face double discrimination for this reason.
The gender-role dynamics compounded with disability stereotyping have put them
in the most marginalised and vulnerable position in terms of both building a career
and developing romantic relationships (Beleza, 2003; Mostert, 2016). Women with
disability in some African countries, such as Ethiopia, are ill-treated and neglected
8.6 Young Love and Romantic Relationships for People with Disabilities               181

by their families, verbally and physically abused and even raped (Spratt, 2017). A
report from the Council of Europe (2003) spells out the fact that many men would
never think of having a sexual relationship with a woman with a disability.
   Recently, Zewude and Habtegiorgis (2021) conducted a study to determine the
willingness of young people without disabilities to have romantic and marital rela-
tionships with persons with disabilities. Of the 403 participants (202 female, 201
male), 85.5% reported that they would not engage in any romantic or marital
relationships with people with disabilities. The reasons for this were:
•   Fear of their family members’ reactions (44.2%).
•   Fear of the reactions of other members of society (40.03%).
•   Fear that they would not live up to their expected role (34.8%).
•   Fear of passing the disability on to their children (16.5%).
•   No stated reason (15.8%).
•   People with disabilities did not meet their criteria of beauty (13.2%).
•   Belief that a person with disability would be asexual (10.3%).
•   Other reasons (8.1%).
•   Religious reasons (1%).
Although this is just a snapshot of a small group of young people, it does reflect a
general view found in most societies across cultures.
    In another study, Ward et al. (2010) interviewed 47 individuals (22 women, 25
men) with some degree of intellectual disability to learn about their romantic rela-
tionships. Of the participants, 83% were single and had never married, and 85% of
them reported that they had had experience of romantic relationships (17 people)
or were in a romantic relationship with someone at the time of the interview (22
people).
    Participants reported that they shared strong emotional feelings with their partners.
They enjoyed each other’s company and supported each other emotionally and in
other areas. Their dating activities included going for walks, watching movies, going
out for dinner, and staying at home and enjoying home activities such as playing
video games. Some stated that they enjoyed flirting with each other, and engaged
in intimate acts including holding each other, kissing and, for a few, having sex.
However, 60% (14 women and 10 men) also reported experiencing physical and
emotional abuse from previous partners, including name-calling, screaming, yelling,
hitting, harassment, threats, denial of food and shelter, financial exploitation, and
destruction of property. One even reported being beaten up by his partner’s stepson.
Five women reported experiencing forced sexual contact in previous relationships.
This is congruent with the findings of previous studies that women with disabilities
are more likely to experience sexual abuse than those without disabilities (Armour
et al., 2008; Reiter et al., 2007; Sobsey, 1994).
    In another study, Azzopardi-Lane et al. (2019) found that people with disabilities
have the same desire as their counterparts without disability to experience romantic
love and relationships, get married, and have a family with children. However, many,
especially women, feel that they do not have as many opportunities as their friends
to meet someone who will relate to them romantically. Some studies have found
182                                            8 Friendships and Romantic Relationships

that young people with disabilities can also be ‘overprotected’ by their parents and
carers. At times, this overprotective behaviour becomes a barrier preventing these
young people from developing social skills and robbing them of the opportunity
to develop more intimate relationships with individuals that they are attracted to
(Callus & Bonello, 2017; Debattista, 2015). Azzopardi-Lane et al. (2019) argue that
parents should be taught how to strike a balance between protecting their teens from
abusive harm in relationships and learning how to empower them to lead a more
independent social life.
    From a personal point of view, as an educator who has worked with young people
with disabilities, I have observed that youngsters with mild disabilities of any form
usually do not experience as many hurdles in finding love and romance as those with
more severe disabilities. Those with vision and hearing impairments, and those with
mobility issues, are also often able to find love, get married, and enjoy a fulfilled
family life. Some of my previous students have married their schoolmates, who
are also visually impaired or have hearing loss, while over half of them married
persons without disabilities. In many cases, these couples met through service-related
situations, with the non-disabled partner being a volunteer in areas such as academic
support or social activities, a nurse or social work professional, or the sibling of a
friend with the same disability. But they all have one thing in common: they see the
person first, not the disability.
    It takes a lot of courage to become romantically involved with a person with
disabilities. Some have to overcome disapproval from their parents and family, or
nasty and discriminatory comments from friends and neighbours. But it is important
that persons with any form of disability get the support they need so that they can
enjoy the same lives as their non-disabled peers. As educators and parents, we still
have a lot to learn, and a lot to do in order to empower them to access and enjoy their
basic human rights.



8.7 Friendships, Romantic Relationships and EI

EI begins with knowing yourself—being in tune with your own feelings and emotions
in different situations. Recognising what triggers unpleasant moods and emotions
such as anger, anxiety or fear is the first step in helping yourself to regulate your
emotions in times of stress and when dealing with change, and to manage your
behaviour. It is an ongoing, lifelong process and it takes time and effort, and a
willingness to master the skills involved. But it is worth it. When we are in control
of our emotions, we can identify how other people’s emotions affect us. We can
learn to read our friends’ emotions better, and perhaps even understand some of the
underlying reasons for them. Consequently, we can develop further skills to help
manage our emotions in friendships and relationships.
   When we become more attuned to our own emotions and the emotions of others
around us, we can become more mindful of how some of our own emotions and
behaviours create barriers in our relationships. We may develop the skills and wisdom
8.7 Friendships, Romantic Relationships and EI                                     183

to ‘hold our tongues’ at times and not voice our opinions so easily, to think about the
language we use when communicating with others, and to differentiate real issues
from minor annoyances.
    Empathy is a key element in EI. It is the ability to understand the thoughts and
emotions of others. It is about perspective-taking, refraining from judgement and
prejudice, and communicating understanding of another person’s emotions. Knowing
how to respond to others with empathy is a skill that requires cognitive, emotional
and behavioural development.
    This chapter has given you some data from research studies to illustrate how
friendships at different stages of our lives affect our mental and social-emotional
health. It also discusses how romance and intimate relationships in adolescence
impact the development of future adult love and marital relationships. I hope it will
inspire you to think about your own friendships and romantic relationships status,
and how you want to strengthen and further develop them.
    Everyone learns differently. There are numerous checklists and articles avail-
able to help you develop or strengthen your self-awareness, self-management, social
awareness and relationship management skills. There are also lots of great books on
how to develop EI, including practical skills and suggestions. The following list of
resources may be helpful.

Workplace Emotions




9.1 Introduction

Emotional Intelligence (EI) is broadly understood in business and professional educa-
tion literature to be an important element of the interpersonal and intrapersonal
skills that help to enhance communication, people management, problem-solving
and decision-making in the workplace, at all levels of staff and leadership, whether
the workplace is a huge corporation, a bank, a supermarket, a school, a hospital or
a small business. This chapter aims to acquaint readers with intriguing research that
explores both EI and the broader issue of emotions in the workplace, including work-
place stress and conflicts, workplace politics and workplace bullying. It discusses how
an increase in EI at both the personal and the organisational level can help to reduce
workplace stress, enhance a harmonious emotional climate within an organisation,
and enrich workplace and employee’s wellbeing.



9.2 The Importance of EI in the Workplace

Emotions affect us in multiple ways: biologically, cognitively, psychologically and
behaviourally. Some people interpret emotions as feelings and moods (Parkinson
et al., 1996); some believe that they influence our behaviour (Buck, 1993); and some
explain them as motivational impulses (Lang, 1995), for example hunger driving a
caveman to hunt for food and fear propelling him to build a house for protection.
The overlapping definitions of emotion, such as moods, affect, and feelings, appear
to be used interchangeably by different authors; however, many argue that they mean
different things depending on the context. Goleman (1998) explained that it is impor-
tant that we understand our emotions and are able to regulate them, especially in the
workplace. Goleman’s works ignited a robust interest in industry psychology in iden-
tifying how emotions in the workplace affect job performance, and how improved
EI can empower an individual to regulate their mood at work, manage their ability to

think, establish better interpersonal relationships through compassion and empathy,
and increase productivity. Carmeli (2003) observed that EI involves a self-awareness
and the ability to perceive one’s own strengths and limitations, self-worth and tech-
nical and professional capabilities accurately. This self-awareness acts as a core
analyst for managing interpersonal relationships and employees’ emotions.
   Studies have produced evidence that those with high levels of EI tend to make
better decisions, work well under pressure, work collaboratively with others to solve
problems, support others to achieve personal and team success, and listen, reflect
and respond to others in positive ways. Those who are low on EI, in contrast, are
more likely to play the role of the victim, refuse to work in a team, have passive or
aggressive communication styles, and be overly critical of others and dismiss their
opinions (e.g., Petrides & Furnham, 2000; Schaubroeck & Jones, 2000; Zapf et al.,
2001).
   The research works of Goleman (2001) McQueen (2004) and Akerjordet and
Severinsson, (2007) found common factors among leaders and staff members who
are high in workplace EI. They include:
• Self-awareness: the ability to understand one’s own emotions, feelings, moods,
  strengths and weaknesses, and how these impact one’s ability to work effectively
  as an individual contributor and as a team member.
• Self-regulation: the ability to manage one’s emotions and behaviour in diffi-
  cult situations, such as by staying calm and composed under pressure and in
  challenging times.
• Other-awareness: the ability to interpret the emotions expressed by others, the
  empathy to understand others’ difficulties, having a sense of the mood and pace
  of the workplace emotional climate and having the ability to maintain a good
  balance in workplace relationships.
• Motivation: the ability to drive oneself (and lead others) to set and achieve goals
  and achieve success.
• Impulse control: the ability to control one’s urge to do something impulsively,
  and instead take time to think about a proper response, even in pressing and
  challenging situations.
• Flexibility: the ability to modify one’s emotions and behaviours to suit changing
  situations and work requirements.
• Optimism: the ability to maintain a positive outlook even in uncertain times and
  to work through ambiguity, especially in meeting business and work demands.
• Conflict management: the ability to handle, manage, negotiate and resolve
  interpersonal or organisational conflicts with clarity and composure.
• Teamwork capabilities: the ability to think as part of a team, to understand the
  team’s frame of mind and work through individual differences to achieve team
  goals and establish team synergy.
Today, the complexity of the world’s demands and the fast-paced changes to society
can overwhelm us. Many of us feel confused and bewildered by the excess of
input from different aspects of our lives. EI can facilitate our capacity for empathy,
reasoning, motivation and resilience, and give us the ability to make sense of this
9.2 The Importance of EI in the Workplace                                           193

crazy world and its perplexing demands on us. When we work to develop and increase
our EI, we will be better equipped to communicate more effectively, to understand
others better and handle stress better, and will have an increased ability to navigate
a plethora of social situations and work conflicts. The benefits and values of EI are
immense in terms of both personal and professional success. It is a core competence
that we need to develop to protect ourselves from both real and imagined threats that
are harmful to our physical and mental health. Having strong EI will help us to cope
with a range of challenges and stress (Bar-on, 2001).
   The interest in emotional intelligence in the workplace stems from the widespread
recognition that these abilities—self-awareness, self-management, empathy and
social skill—separate the most successful workers and leaders from the average.
This is especially true in roles like the professions and higher-level executives, where
everyone is about as smart as everyone else, and how people manage themselves and
their relationships gives the best and edge (Goleman, 2019).
   To increase our EI in the workplace, we must be aware of and understand the
relationship between it and our emotions. Studies of emotions in the workplace have
grown exponentially during the last two decades, as demonstrated in the tremendous
surge in business literature and organisational psychology research articles being
published. For example, Frost (2003) indicated that discontented employees tend to
disconnect from their work and workplace, resulting in a lower sense of workplace
commitment and a decrease in job performance. Employees who are passionate about
their work and devoted to their workplace, in contrast, go the extra mile. Allen and
Meyer (1990) identified work commitment as having three components. These are:
• Affective commitment: People who have affection for their job form an emotional
  attachment to their workplace (organisation) and the work they do. They identify
  with the goals and values of the organisation, and they genuinely want to be there
  and contribute their best to the workplace.
• Continuance commitment: This refers to the need to remain in the same state.
  Some people are committed to their job because they need it for monetary purpose
  (salary and benefits), for professional recognition (while working in an esteemed
  organisation or a role with an important status) or for the social contacts and
  relationships that they have established throughout the years.
• Normative commitment: This refers to a sense of obligation that can stem from
  being brought up to value loyalty, or feeling a strong sense of gratitude because
  the organisation has invested heavily in a person’s education and growth, privi-
  leges and benefits (e.g., paying for children’s tuition, a company car, a housing
  allowance, etc.), or gratitude to the business owner or top-level management.
These three types of commitment are not mutually exclusive, but can be experienced
simultaneously to varying degrees. Knowing about the passion we have for our work
and understanding the different levels of commitment we feel towards our workplace
can help us to realise what is important to us and to our work lives. Likewise, when the
leaders of an organisation understand the different levels of commitment among their
employees, they can identify gaps that cause employees to disconnect and develop
ways to motivate them, provide needed development or inspire and coach them.
194                                                              9 Workplace Emotions

   There is now an abundance of business literature showing that EI matters in
the workplace. Business schools and professional agencies are teaching business
executives how to boost their EI in order to increase their people and relationship
skills and better manage their staff. However, some models may be oversimplified
and vague, focusing mainly on the ‘what’ (e.g., what is workplace EI?) and not the
‘how’ (e.g., how do I develop EI?). In 2003, Ashkanasy developed a 5-level model to
elaborate how one can understand workplace emotions from multiple perspectives.
The five levels include:
1.    Within-person level: This involves individuals being aware of their own
      emotions, how their emotional states and situational influences (events) affect
      their moods and behaviour, and how these, in turn, affect their work and job
      performance.
2.    Between-person level: This involves an understanding of individual differences
      between co-workers. It includes their affective commitment, job satisfaction,
      personality traits, burnout points and how they impact interpersonal relation-
      ships. It takes account of the level of EI shown by the individuals involved,
      and how well they can perceive, understand and manage their own and other’s
      moods and emotions.
3.    Interpersonal-interaction level: This includes how one manages emotions
      when communicating and relating to others. It encompasses how emotions are
      displayed and felt. It requires individuals to understand the emotional exchange
      in interactions, and the emotional labour involved (emotional labour is the
      process of managing one’s emotions and feelings as a requirement of a job—for
      example, shop assistants and waiting staff having to smile while serving their
      customers and not react with anger or impatience when the customer is annoying
      or unreasonable).
4.    Group level: This requires an understanding of the affective composition of
      the group, and of emotional contagion (e.g., how someone being depressed or
      angry can induce a similar emotional reaction in others in a group through their
      body language, facial expressions and choice of words). It also includes the
      influence of leader-member exchanges and interactions, and the EI levels of
      group members.
5.    Organisation-wide level: This includes an understanding of the organisation’s
      policies, requirements for emotional labour, stress and wellbeing, and emotional
      climate and culture (i.e., the general atmosphere of the organisation—whether it
      is a cheerful organisation with an optimistic and supportive culture, or a gloomy
      and pessimistic, hierarchical culture where everyone is struggling for power).
Workplace EI can be learned and mastered when staff members are given appropriate
development and education. However, it is not as easy as many bloggers make it
out to be. David Caruso, a management psychologist at Yale Center for Emotional
Intelligence, has pointed out that it is a misconception that EI can be easily learned.
It requires deep understanding, a wide scope of organisational knowledge and a
range of skills (Caruso & Salovey, 2004). The following sections will define EI in
the context of the workplace, and use research data and evidence-based approaches
9.2 The Importance of EI in the Workplace                                          195

to look at how we can develop needed EI capabilities for self-improvement and to
improve the wellbeing of our co-workers and staff in the workplace.



9.3 Workplace Stress and Conflicts

Workplace stress and conflicts exist everywhere. Improving our EI can help us to
manage stress, empathise with others, build strong relationships and achieve goals.
When we have a clearer understanding of the different angles of workplace stress
and conflict, we can assess and affect situations and relationships more effectively,
be more able to cope with demands and work pressure, and be better able to navigate
and negotiate these workplace challenges.
   Workplace stress is defined as adverse physical or mental reactions towards tension
in the workplace. It has become a big concern in many advanced societies and has
been proven to have harmful impacts on both employees and employers (Ahmed
et al., 2020). Workplace stress occurs when individuals face work demands that do
not match their capabilities and knowledge, or when work pressures exceed their
ability to operate effectively. Social and environmental factors in the workplace can
also contribute to workplace stress (Semmer, 2007).
   A 2007 Australian study commissioned by Medibank found that unhealthy
employees take nine times more sick leave than healthy workers, while healthy
employees are three times more productive than their unhealthy counterparts
(Australian Safety & Compensation Council, 2007). Employees are often exposed
to different issues that cause stress, and chronic job stress can lead to workplace and
organisational ineffectiveness, which in turn causes low productivity and poor-quality
work, increases accidents, risks and high staff turnover, and leads to complaints from
clients and customers.
   A 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) report identified three key issues that
can lead to workplace stress:
1.   Physical issues: This is caused by heavy workloads resulting in physical exhaus-
     tion that hinders concentration and clear thinking, and leads to other physical
     sicknesses.
2.   Ethical issues: This is caused by conflicts or misunderstandings that arise due
     to poor communication.
3.   Role-related issues: This is caused by an employee having to take up multiple
     roles or change roles frequently. It can also include work-life imbalance when
     employees struggle to manage both work and family demands.
Helpguide, a not-for-profit Californian organisation which supports the mental health
of the American public, had also identified common stressors in the workplace (2021).
These include:
• The physical environment: noise and overcrowding, health and safety risks, and
  ergonomic factors such as office furniture and use of computers.
196                                                             9 Workplace Emotions

• Work factors: unreasonable performance demands, excessive work hours.
• Organisational practices: poor communication, lack of autonomy, unclear roles
  and responsibilities.
• Workplace change: job insecurity, lack of opportunities for promotion, high staff
  turnover.
• Relationships: poor interpersonal relationships, office politics, poor supervisor-
  staff relationships, bullying or harassment, excessive competition and conflict.
A stressful work environment can cause health problems such as headaches, sleep
disturbances, short tempers and poor concentration, and lead to anxiety, insomnia,
high blood pressure and weakened immune systems. Compounding the problem,
people who experience excessive stress often deal with it in unhealthy ways, such as
smoking, overeating, eating unhealthy foods or drinking excessive alcohol, resulting
in obesity, heart diseases and mental health issues.
   WHO (2007) has pinpointed three ways to prevent and manage workplace stress:
1.    Primary prevention: This refers to reducing stress through better ergonomics and
      environmental design, to create a more comfortable workplace environment, and
      paying attention to organisational and management development.
2.    Secondary prevention: This refers to reducing stress by providing education,
      training and development to both workers and leaders.
3.    Tertiary prevention: This refers to developing sensitive and responsive manage-
      ment systems to enhance occupational health.
At the individual level, employees can reduce their stress by being self-aware of
their needs, strengths, and limitations, and identifying ways to seek help when they
feel stressed. They can develop healthy lifestyle habits and take regular exercise and
relaxation. Workwise, the individual can also take a proactive stance and:
• create a balanced schedule by managing their time and priorities purposefully,
• plan short, regular breaks to relax and recharge in order to be more productive,
• be mindful not to over-commit, and break large projects into small steps to avoid
  becoming overwhelmed,
• delegate responsibility and build trust and collaboration with others, and
• communicate to make their needs known and seek help when necessary.
• Stress management techniques can be taught to staff members and leaders to build
  a healthy emotional climate in the organisation.


9.3.1 Workplace Conflicts

Conflicts occur naturally in all human interactions. Workplace conflict can arise
when there are disagreements, differences of opinion, clashes of beliefs and prior-
ities, competition for resources, personality differences, perceived incompatibility,
disrespect, discrimination and injustice. The consequences of conflict can impact
organisations and workplaces in different ways. Poorly managed conflict can be
9.3 Workplace Stress and Conflicts                                                  197

costly in both human and financial terms; it can result in wasted time and resources
and shape counterproductive workplace behaviour, which can lead to unnecessary
costs such as health-related problems or even litigation.
    At the personal level, workplace conflict can cause emotional exhaustion, which
affects attitudes and staff morale, resulting in lower job satisfaction and job perfor-
mance. Consequently, it can negatively impact the emotional climate of the work-
place, causing decreased levels of trust, cooperation and collegial support, while also
increasing the level of collective work stress, tension and even aggression (Jaramillo
et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014).
    While conflict generally has negative connotations, numerous scholars in organ-
isational studies have analysed the causes and consequences of workplace conflicts
and identified some constructive elements of such discords (e.g., Chan et al., 2008;
Epitropaki & Martin, 2005; Hullman, 2004). They found that through conflict, people
can learn to see different perspectives and the pros and cons of different viewpoints.
When handled and managed positively and effectively, workplace conflicts can there-
fore actually enhance decision-making, inspire creativity, increase group unity and
cooperation, increase respect and improve future communication.
    Other writers (e.g., Bano & Pierce, 2013; Vue et al., 2017) have also indicated
that differences in personalities, and the perceptions that individuals have of their
co-workers’ behaviour, can also impact the frequency of workplace conflicts. From
time to time we all experience tension and discomfort when working with people
who appear to be ‘difficult’ and unpleasant to work with. Some of them may behave
in ways that are strongly associated with their personalities at all times, while others
may behave differently with different people and in different circumstances. These
‘difficult people’—some of whom we have probably all encountered in our work
lives now and again, may include :
• the backstabber, who puts on a friendly face but secretly undermines others with
  malicious gossip and rumours.
• the busybody, who loves to meddle in other people’s business and eavesdrop on
  everything so as to gain power by ‘knowing everything in the workplace’.
• the complainer, who usually plays the victim by complaining a lot and offering
  very little.
• the yes-person, who grovels to upper management and tends to over-promise and
  under-deliver.
• the no-person, who refuses to cooperate for a variety of different excuses.
• the harasser, who personally attacks co-workers and tries to set others up to fail
  in order to impress the boss.
Do bear in mind that we all have a tendency to judge and quickly categorise people into
stereotypes! How these distinct judgements come together to form an overall impres-
sion of someone is a very subjective process that can be affected by numerous vari-
ables, including our own personal traits, our past experiences, and our expectations
of the person we are judging.
   Bano and Pierce (2013) argue that our behaviour is motivated by our physical and
psychological needs and wants, and an innate desire for balance. To be able to work
198                                                                 9 Workplace Emotions

with these ‘difficult’ people, it is important to first understand their quest for balance.
What do they want? Why are they behaving the way they do? It is easier said than
done, but if we begin by looking at the behaviour and not the person, we can learn
to think about them differently and adopt a positive attitude, and make the necessary
change we desire. Again, self-awareness and other-awareness play an essential part
in handling ‘difficult’ people. Keep track of your emotions (e.g., excitement, unease,
frustration, disappointment) associated with specific uncomfortable incidents—for
example, when you feel you are being disrespected or criticised publicly, rejected
offensively, ignored or excluded, or betrayed. You may observe that your responses
to these events can vary based on your frame of mind at a certain time, or on a certain
day, or if the circumstances surrounding the situation are different. Acknowledge
these emotions and identify their triggers. What particular actions or behaviours from
other people will trigger these emotions (e.g., I feel angry when...I feel frustrated
when...)? Developing mindfulness skills can help you become more self-aware and
in tune with your feelings, and to understand what triggers them. This way, you can
find helpful ways to cope, or strategies to resolve the conflict.
    Communication is key to all human relationships. Whether you are a supervisor,
the CEO, or a junior assistant in a workplace, having good communication skills will
take you far in achieving your goals. Pretending that workplace conflict or harass-
ment does not matter and trying to avoid facing these challenges, on the other hand,
will only make things worse. Goleman (2019) states that managers and supervisors
who are high in EI and trained in conflict resolution skills are able to minimise
organisational and workplace conflict. Some of the techniques involved in doing this
are:
• facilitating face-to-face meetings with the conflicting parties to identify problems
  and resolve them through open discussion.
• creating shared goals that cannot be attained without the cooperation of the
  conflicting parties.
• ensuring that resources are equally available to all and shared evenly.
• facilitating understanding between the conflicting parties and playing down their
  differences while stressing their common interests.
• helping the conflicting parties to make compromises to reach a satisfactory
  outcome.
• using formal authority where necessary to communicate a desire for the conflict
  to be resolved and to resolve it.
At the organisational level, management can put in place policies and procedures
to create constructive norms to address team and interpersonal conflicts (Gosline &
Stallworth, 2001). These strategies can include:
• providing multiple options for employees to raise and address conflicts.
• supporting confidentiality and safety.
• incorporating systemic structures and support that coordinate access to and use
  of various options to address conflict.
9.3 Workplace Stress and Conflicts                                                 199

• providing all staff with training and development in understanding conflicts and
  conflict resolution, and negotiation skills.
• employing an integrated conflict management system to prevent, manage and
  resolve conflict that focuses on not only solving but also preventing conflicts.
When organisations are able to put in place systems to help staff and workers deal with
conflicts, it will not only increase organisational efficiency and workplace justice,
but also build a more harmonious and optimistic emotional climate in the workplace.



9.4 The Emotional Climate of the Workplace

Our jobs are not just a source of income but a source of purpose and meaning; they
provide us with a social identity, satisfaction and contentment, a sense of belonging
and a sense of community. Every workplace has its own culture and emotional
climate. This refers to the values and purpose of the organisation and the workforce
as a whole—their attitudes, commitments, interpersonal communications and rela-
tionships. Within the workplace culture there is an element of emotional temperature.
Are the people in the workplace generally optimistic, cheerful, helpful, supportive
and positive, or are they mostly gloomy, grouchy and irritable? Emotionality and
rationality coexist in a workplace. Of course, there are up days when the majority of
the workplace is filled with high energy, and down days when it is filled with a misty
gloom and undercurrents of anger and impatience, and people are irritated with each
other.
    As early as the 1900s, sociologist Emile Durkheim noticed that people shared
emotions as a group (Lukes, 1972). He postulated that we humans exist with two
consciousnesses: an individual consciousness, which is about our individuality and
uniqueness, and a collective consciousness, which is about the values, beliefs and
ideas common to a group or society. He described this shared consciousness as ‘the
spirit of the people’. Subsequent scholastic writing has elaborated on this shared
feeling—collective emotions—and began to investigate how such emotions affect
the individual’s emotions (e.g., Bar-Tal et al., 2007; Goldenberg et al., 2014; Von
Scheve & Salmela, 2014). From these discussions, we have learned that there are two
types of collective emotion: non-group-based emotions (e.g., when the passengers
on a bus become angry with the reckless driving of the bus driver), and group-based
emotions (e.g., when women in the #metoo movement shared the same sentiment
over sexual harassment).
    Non-group-based emotions are shared by multiple people who are not related.
They are common sentiments: for example, fear caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
or grief caused by the death of a popular celebrity (e.g., Mother Teresa, Princess
Diana). Group-based emotions describe the feelings of people who share a similar
identity (such feelings can include national pride, negative emotions due to racial
discrimination, shared joy at achieving the most Olympic gold medals, etc.). And
emotions are contagious. When you walk into the workplace and are welcomed by
200                                                              9 Workplace Emotions

smiling faces and friendly greetings, it will most certainly lift your mood, whereas if
you walk in and everyone is sleepy and dull, it might dim your enthusiasm and pretty
soon you will find yourself yawning and feeling lethargic too. When we are more
attuned to how emotional contagion affects us in the workplace, we can help to lift
the mood, keep the emotional temperature in the positive range and raise workplace
performance.
   Leaders who are aware of how emotions affect the workplace will be mindful of
how they impact both individuals and work teams, and might consider elevating the
importance of positive human qualities like empathy, compassion, kindness, respect,
patience, understanding, honesty, trust and forgiveness in the work organisation.
Workplaces, large or small, need to put in place support mechanisms to enhance a
supportive social and emotional climate in the workplace, and reduce stress, conflicts
and tensions. This requires skills and development both for leaders (small business
owners, HR professionals, departmental leaders) and staff members at different levels
through onboarding training and ongoing development programs.
   Strong interpersonal relationships will support individuals in a workplace to
become more resilient, knowing that they are trusted, valued and supported. To build
a high-performing workplace, leaders must realise that employees need to find their
work fulfilling and know that they are appreciated. The workplace atmosphere and the
physical environment that the employer or team leaders create, and the relationships
they build, are vital for this. It can be done by:
•   creating a strong sense of the team and a clear sense of belonging.
•   creating a culture of support and friendliness.
•   discouraging gossip and unnecessary comments about personal issues.
•   giving employees choices and empowering them to work alone or collaboratively
    on individual or group initiatives.
•   helping employees feel connected and informed through both formal and informal
    communication.
•   being clear about the roles and responsibilities of individuals and teams, and
    avoiding excessive multitasking and cognitive overload.
•   providing breaks and break areas so that employees can manage their sensory
    stimulation, keep calm and connect with others for social support.
•   developing skills in giving positive feedback.
•   developing skills in receiving feedback as a learning process.
•   encouraging creativity, teamwork and collaboration.
•   organising recreational sport teams to enhance bonding outside work.
•   organising after-work interest groups (e.g., music or creative performance groups,
    book clubs).
•   celebrating! Having regular fun sessions to celebrate success and other important
    workplace and social events (e.g., birthdays, sales target achievements, etc.).
Emotions play a significant role in the workplace. Employees’ performance, deci-
sions and actions are linked to emotions at the personal, interpersonal and group
levels. A positive workplace climate will help to promote workplace wellbeing and
organisational growth.
9.5 Workplace Politics                                                                201

9.5 Workplace Politics

Workplace politics, more commonly known as ‘office politics’ to many, appear to
be a taboo in most people’s mind—something to be frowned upon. In organisational
and business literature, the term ‘workplace politics’ has multiple definitions. They
include:
• the unwritten rules that determine who gets what, when, and how in an organisation
  (Laswell & Blumenstock, 1939).
• a manifestation of social influences processes that are prevalent to organisational
  life (Gotsis & Kortezi, 2010).
• a natural social process, which can be positive or negative, to influence decision-
  making, communication and innovation (Hochwarter, 2012).
• necessary practices for building and using relationships, building personal repu-
  tation, controlling decisions and resources, and influencing decision-making and
  interpersonal and organisational communications (Landells & Albrecht, 2017).


9.5.1 Harmful Workplace Politics

In past decades, researchers have studied workplace politics and employee engage-
ment from different angles and established different theories to explain such practices.
These include the demand-control theory (Karasek, 1979), the person-environment
fit theory (Caplan, 1987), the conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989), the
effort-reward imbalance theory (Siegrist, 2001) and the appraisal theory (Troup &
Dewe, 2002). Findings from these and many other related studies unearthed the
point that despite the predominant view that workplace politics are harmful and have
negative outcomes for both the organisation and individuals, they can be used in
positive ways to benefits employees and achieve organisational outcomes. However,
studies have also provided evidence that a highly political environment can cause
low employee job satisfaction, inadequate commitment, low productivity and even
detrimental organisational behaviour (Chang et al., 2009; Ferris et al., 2002).
    Forms of office ‘dirty politics’, include tactics such as manipulation, backstab-
bing, undermining others and putting them down, passing the buck, taking credit for
groups’ or other employees’ achievements, blaming, gossiping and passing rumours
to destroy another’s reputation and trustworthiness (Byrne et al., 2017; Chang et al.,
2009; Kahn, 1990; Li et al., 2014). Some people use gossip as a political tactic for self-
serving purposes, by making harmful comments to devalue others and ensuring that
they spread like wildfire. McAndrews et al. (2007) found that high-status managers
and work supervisors are usually the targets for negative gossip, and Ellwardt et al.
(2012) echoed this claim, adding that many target them due to their distrust of people
in management positions. Brady et al. (2017) state that gossips normally spread
rumours about their supervisors and co-workers behind their backs for different
reasons, such as envy, competition, revenge or a sense of insecurity. Workplace
202                                                               9 Workplace Emotions

gossip is frequently viewed as a harmful form of office politics, as it breaks down
trust between employees and their supervisors, undermines individuals, groups and
corporate governance, strains the ethical values of the workplace, and consequently
decreases staff motivation, interpersonal relationships and staff morale (Grosser et al.,
2002).
    Some studies define workplace politics as becoming harmful when staff members
or leaders in management use them for self-serving purposes, without regard for
the wellbeing of others or the organisation (Kacmar & Baron, 1999). Regardless,
when the workplace becomes too political, employees’ stress levels will rise, and as
a result, their engagement and productivity will drop (Byrne et al., 2017; Hakanen
et al., 2006).
    Power—the ability to influence someone in order to achieve goals—is important
for some individuals. Some people engage in harmful politics to manipulate others
so they can gain power and be seen as superior or as an esteemed leader, or to defeat
an opponent or competitor, win a project or attain a position of greater authority
(Yulk, 1989). Others consciously or unconsciously use politics to sabotage group or
organisational outcomes due to fear of the unknown, increased psychological strain
caused by workplace stress and workload demands, or perceptions of unfair treatment
(Chang, et al., 2009). Some people are driven by specific personality traits such as
aggressiveness, competitiveness, and the need to control and dominate (Wakou et al.,
2003). Bad workplace politics tend to arise when there is excessive competition at
the top, when the organisation structure is complex (e.g., when a team of employees
has to report to two or three different bosses), when there are limited resources within
the organisation, when jobs are at risk (e.g., in a threatening climate like an economic
downturn or a global pandemic), when top management levels are rigid and fail to
lead necessary change to meet changes in the work environment, and especially when
interpersonal relationships are weak.
    In a workplace riddled with harmful workplace politics, where the executives
are predominantly focused on increasing their power or plumping up their wallets,
one can see ongoing power struggles and power plays taking place. In these toxic
workplaces, management and team leaders have a ‘my way or the highway’ atti-
tude and seldom consider employees’ personal or family issues. Supervisors pay
more attention to what employees do wrong than what they do right, and problems
automatically trigger a search for a scapegoat. Internal conflicts are common and
entire departments might be at war with other departments within the organisation.
Gossip, putdowns and backstabbing are common among co-workers, and people talk
to management only if it is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, such hellish work-
places do exist, including in big corporations and government organisations such as
hospitals, schools and social services departments.
    To survive such harmful workplaces, individuals need to be emotionally adept—
to be able to manage their own emotions as well as those of the people around
them. When we are high on self-awareness and self-management skills, and have
the capability to negotiate challenging situations using increased social awareness
and relationship management skills, we become able to ignore ignorant remarks and
focus on important work goals. When we are empathetic and compassionate, we can
9.5 Workplace Politics                                                                   203

lend an ear to our colleagues to help them overcome the harshness of a brutal work
culture, or even take a step further and help to create a changed culture, especially if
we hold a leadership position.



9.5.2 Helpful Workplace Politics

Recent organisational studies have produced evidence that not all workplace poli-
tics are bad. In fact, some claim that when they are aligned with the organisa-
tion’s goals and ethics, effective workplace politics can be helpful in improving
decision-making, communication and innovation in the organisation, enhancing
career advancement and organisational change (Vigoda-Gadaot & Kapun, 2005),
and increasing collaboration and trust (Kurchner-Hawkins & Miller, 2006).
    Low (2009, 2011) points out that instead of avoiding workplace politics, organ-
isations can benefit teaching their staff to harness positive politics to build a posi-
tive organisational culture. Good politics involve advancing one’s interests without
neglecting other people’s rights and the organisation’s legitimate interests. Today,
effective organisations value individuals who are politically savvy—those who can
get things done with others by understanding interpersonal dynamics, the political
roles people play in the organisation, and their own and others’ political behaviours
and attitudes.
    Ferris et al. (2002) have indicated that a person who is competent at workplace
politics can enhance job performance and build a cohesive and trusting organ-
isation/workplace. They pointed out four key skills necessary to build political
savvy:
1.   Social intelligence: This involves being self-aware and other-aware, and having
     the ability to see how others see you and how your behaviour impact them.
2.   Social and relational influence: This involves understanding the needs and
     wants of employees and having the ability to communicate with them and align
     organisational goals to match their abilities and agendas.
3.   Networking capability: This involves having the ability to form mutually bene-
     ficial relationships with a range of diverse people. It is the ability to relate to both
     friends and foes so to establish constructive connections, enhance cooperation
     and reduce opposition.
4.   Sincerity and authenticity: This involves building trust with people and
     presenting a responsible image that is representative of your true self.
Whether one is a leader or a just a cog in a larger organisation, it is important to be
attuned to organisational politics. Some people are naturally alert to their environment
and are able to see around corners and over the horizon. They know where the power
lies, and understand how to leverage it to achieve goals. This political shrewdness is
constructive when it is used to achieve organisational agendas and goals. However,
when it becomes self-serving with egotistic motives, then it can be harmful both to
the individual and to the workplace.
204                                                                 9 Workplace Emotions

9.5.3 Perceptions of Workplace Politics

Every individual has his or her own perception of reality. Our perception of workplace
politics is therefore filtered through our lenses of past experience, thoughts and
values. This perception is heightened when people experience high levels of stress due
to excessive workplace politics that can cause employee burnout and high turnover
(Chang et al., 2009; Tong et al., 2015), and workplace politics have been cited in
numerous workforce surveys as one of the least enjoyable aspects of organisational
life (Bruzzese, 2014; Gallup, 2015). However, Witt et al. (2000) have indicated that
the way one perceives workplace politics is more important than the actual presence of
the workplace politics and climate themselves. Employee perceptions of workplace
politics are usually negative; they are perceived as being inherently unfair because
they imply a lack of meritocracy, the presence of favouritism and in-groups, power
struggles, personal animosities, egos and ambitions, and power that is retained in the
hands of only a top few (Ferris & Kacmar, 1992).
    Ferris et al. (2000) indicate that perceptions of organisational politics are asso-
ciated with how people perceive the intent behind their co-workers’ or supervisors’
behaviours, especially if they are regarded as self-serving rather than other-serving
or organisation-serving. In a work environment that is highly politically charged,
employees who perceive workplace politics to be stressful, ambiguous and frus-
trating may leave the organisation. Some may remain but take care not to become
involved in the politics, while others may attempt to engage in political activities in
order to gain some control over the workplace environment. Employees caught in a
highly political workplace soon learn to cope by engaging in political behaviour such
as ingratiation and grovelling to gain favour from supervisors and upper manage-
ment, and scholars in organisational studies have found that in highly politicised
workplaces, employees coping with uncertainty and lack of control would betray
their own moral values, commitment and loyalty to pursuit their own interest and
secure their survival in the organisation (Low, 2011).
    In contrast, some researchers have found that employees with high moral efficacy
showed minimal fear of their own interests being undermined by adverse political
behaviour. This illustrates that if employees’ perceptions of the organisational envi-
ronment are positive, then they will maintain good relationships with the organisation
and continue to show good organisational citizenship behaviour (Purba et al., 2015).
Several scholars have found that people with a positive mindset are able to respond
to workplace politics with a confident and constructive voice, and counter personal
and career risks in such unhealthy work environments (Burris, 2012). While many
hold the belief that it is unsafe to express their grievances or objections to unfair prac-
tices in the workplace, as it might negatively affect their status and career outcomes
(Detert & Edmondson, 2011), those who are willing to voice their opinions are able
to gain more support from the organisation (Burris, 2012; Li et al, 2014).
    EI in the workplace involves having an awareness of how the political climate
affects one’s own emotions and those of others. This means, in addition to self-
awareness (how you respond to workplace politics) and other-awareness (how other
9.5 Workplace Politics                                                              205

people are mutually influencing each other with their political behaviour), one must
also develop an awareness of the political environment in the workplace. By paying
attention to acquiring insight, knowledge, tools and wisdom to help you navigate
the political territory effectively, you will be able to navigate tricky circumstances,
manage delicate workplace relationships and stay true to your moral values.
    This can be achieved by developing an understanding of the organisation hierarchy
and mapping the political power and influence to find out who the real influencers are,
how they exercise their power and influence, and how they communicate and relate
to others (in both positive and negative ways). It is helpful to pay attention to how
people interact in order to understand formal and informal work and social networks.
Many non-business professionals such as teachers and nurses may not have heard
of or know about stakeholder analysis and stakeholder management. Being aware
of who the stakeholders are in your workplace will help you to remove barriers and
enhance your work projects and initiatives, and give you more resources to support
your work. Ignoring workplace politics is a naïve choice, because someday you may
fall victim to self-serving persons, but this does not mean you have to take sides
and become ‘one of them’. Stay true to your course and do not let political dramas
divide you from your co-workers. Be brave and stand by your values. Be decisive,
and make sure not to develop double standards. Speak honestly and maintain your
trustworthiness. Dare to make things happen and advocate for change. And as the
old saying goes: have the serenity to accept things you cannot change, the courage
to change the things you can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Find support
from other people outside the workplace. Seek advice and coaching if need be. Stay
positive.



9.6 Workplace Bullying

Over the last two decades, research into workplace bullying has grown exponentially,
with data showing a prevalence of workplace bullying across the world and illus-
trating that such occurrences are not only harmful to employees’ health but can be
crippling to businesses and organisations (e.g., Einarsen & Nielsen, 2015; Fevre et al.,
2010). Research interest in workplace bullying grew from the work of Heinz Leymann
in Scandinavia in the 1980s; Leymann described such behaviour as ‘mobbing’, illus-
trating a victim who was mistreated by a group and left feeling isolated, unsupported,
or discriminated against (Leymann, 1996). Subsequent writers collected more data
on the subject of workplace bullying, and referred these actions as ‘workplace inci-
vility’, ‘workplace aggression’ and ‘emotional abuse in the workplace’ (Keashly &
Jagatic, 2003). Workplace bullying threatens the psychological safety of employees
and affects their work-life quality, leading to reduced job satisfaction and lowering
their productivity and efficiency.
206                                                              9 Workplace Emotions

9.6.1 What is Workplace Bullying?

Authors of studies on workplace bullying have given different definitions of
workplace bullying across the years in the millennium. These definitions include:
• emotional abuse and mistreat of employees, primarily at the hands of supervisors,
  but also including peer bullying (Einarsen & Mikkelsen, 2003).
• a series of escalating and persistent negative events that result in social exclusion
  and harassment of an individual, while at the same time undermining their personal
  and professional reputation in the workplace (Salin, 2003).
• an extreme psychosocial risk at work, in which a number of negative behaviours
  such as the withholding of information that affects performance, the spreading of
  rumours, social isolation and verbal abuse are frequently and persistently directed
  over time at one individual employee (Einarsen et al., 2011).
• a subjective perception by the victims that the repeated acts directed at them are
  hostile, humiliating and intimidating (Einarsen et al., 2011).
• the prolonged and repeated exposure to negative, degrading or offending acts at
  work, against which targets find it difficult to defend themselves (Hogh et al.,
  2016).
Workplace bullying is prevalent globally. In Australia, there are anti-bulling laws in
place to protect workers. Here is an example of how workplace bullying is defined
in the Australian legal context:
• Workplace bullying means any behaviour that is repeated, systematic and directed
  towards an employee or group of employees that a reasonable person, having
  regard to the circumstances, would expect to victimise, humiliate, undermine or
  threaten and which creates a risk to health and safety. (Australian Occupational
  Health, Safety and Welfare Act, 1986 (Section 19))
• Unreasonable and inappropriate workplace behaviour, which comprise behaviour
  which intimidates, offends, degrades, insults or humiliates an employee possibly
  in front of co-workers, client or customers, and which includes physical or
  psychological behaviour. (Law Society of New South Wales, Australia, 2004,
  p. 6)
• A worker is bullied at work when another individual or groups of individuals
  repeatedly behave unreasonably towards the worker and that behaviour creates a
  risk to health and safety. (Australian Fair Work Act, 2009, amended in 2014, p. 6,
  Section 789FD-1)


9.6.2 Factors Contributing to Workplace Bullying

In the literature, workplace bullying is generally described from the individual and
organisational perspectives. Many scholars identify personality characteristics as a
factor that allows individuals to fall victim to workplace bullying, and the evidence
9.6 Workplace Bullying                                                               207

suggests that people who are shy, anxious or sensitive, those with low social skills, and
those who appear to be neurotic, submissive and non-controversial are more likely to
become targets of bullying (e.g., Coyne et al., 2003; Einarsen et al., 2011). Contrarily,
other scholars have found that personality has little to do with one being targeted
for workplace bullying, and maintain that people who are skilled in social compe-
tence, self-reflection and perspective-taking are more likely to overcome bullying
behaviours directed towards them (e.g., Matthiessen & Einarsen, 2010; Zapf et al.,
2001).
   At the organisational level, researchers found that organisations with complex
structures, authoritative hierarchies and predefined power structures influenced the
way jobs are conceived and designed, and provide conducive environments and
conditions for workplace bullying (Apaydin, 2012; Ngale, 2016; Rockett et al., 2017).
   Chappell and Di Martino (2006) proposed a work environment approach to
understanding workplace bullying, and identified several risk factors. These include:
• Contextual risk factors: globalisation, job insecurity, team diversity and tech-
  nology change can contribute to competition, disagreement and workplace
  conflicts.
• Organisational level risk factors: organisational hierarchy, leadership, reward
  systems, bureaucracy, maintenance of tradition, and organisational change.
• Task-level risk factors: role conflict, low autonomy, high workload, job ambiguity,
  lack of skill utilisation, monotonous tasks, forced cooperation and lack of goal
  clarity.
• Societal risk factors: negative culture and values, increased intolerance of
  aggression.
When leaders in the organisation are aware of these risk factors, they can put in place
measures to prevent the practice of bullying in the workplace, reduce stress and de-
escalate conflict, and build a more harmonious workplace climate and a cooperative
culture free from bullying.



9.6.3 Why Do People Bully?

Workplace bullying can take place in a downward direction (from supervisors to their
staff), an upward one (from staff to their supervisors), or a horizontal one (from peers
to co-workers). A broad variety of motives and reasons for it have been discovered
by researchers. Disturbingly, numerous studies have shown that bullying behaviours
were learned at school and brought forward into the workplace. This evidence points
to the fact that many workplace bullies were either bullies or victims of bullies at
school (Brotheridge & Lee, 2010; Lereya et al., 2015; Magee et al., 2015; Peskin
at al., 2006). Some scholars have opined that perpetrators bully because they feel
insecure, and are driven by envy and jealousy that their targets are smarter and more
competent than them. Many are fearful of losing authority and respect because they
208                                                                 9 Workplace Emotions

feel less knowledgeable or experienced than their targets, or have other self-serving
interests (Glambek et al., 2014; Park & Ono, 2016).
    Organisational culture can play a huge role in condoning workplace bullying.
When organisations fail to acknowledge bullying and instead see it as ‘firm manage-
ment’, they condone a cultural norm of tolerance for aggression and dominance, and
in some cases, victims who complain and witnesses supporting them are punished
instead. Luckily, many negative and abusive workplace interactions, traditionally
approved of in the past, are now considered to be improper, unethical and abusive,
and are guarded against by legal policies designed to protect the welfare of workers
and employees (Escartín et al., 2011; Han & Ha, 2016). Yet such toxic cultures
still exist all over the world, in professional institutions such as universities, in the
health profession, and in governments. Scholars have expressed regret that to date,
not enough is known to be able to explain why such practices still exist, and called
for further in-depth investigation into cultural factors to better understand workplace
bullying (Anderson & Bushman, 2002; Hollis, 2017).
    However, it is increasingly being recognised that bullying can have legal conse-
quences for organisations. In many advanced countries, governments are taking
action to protect the wellbeing of employees by advising organisations and supporting
them in raising awareness of and understand what workplace bullying looks like and
how to handle it. Some of this advice includes raising awareness at all levels of
staff and leadership, putting in place policies and grievance procedures to provide
support for victims of bullying, and providing training and development to educate
staff on how to manage conflict and develop better communication, anger manage-
ment, stress management, diversity management, emotional regulation and work-life
balance strategies.
    Empathy is a major part of EI. It refers to our ability to sense and feel the emotions,
thoughts and perspectives of others. When everyone in the organisation has developed
boosted EI, the workplace will be more understanding and tolerant and this may
decrease the occurrence of workplace bullying.



9.7 Workplace Wellbeing

Workplace wellbeing is about how employees and workers feel about their work,
their work environment and their relationships with the people they work with. For
large organisations and small businesses to thrive, they need employees who are
productive and motivated and who feel safe at and secure about their jobs. Leaders
and management therefore need to ensure that their employees and workers are
healthy, safe, engaged and satisfied with their work and workplace. Workplace well-
being is necessary to help employees deal with challenges, weather storms, minimise
stress and manage their mental health. It is paramount to reducing and preventing
workplace accidents, minimising sick leave, decreasing conflict, avoiding declines in
productivity, preventing burnout, and creating a more supportive workplace culture
for all.
9.7 Workplace Wellbeing                                                           209

    Mental health issues are now the leading cause of short-term sick leave and long-
term work incapacity in many developed countries, costing businesses and govern-
ments billions of dollars each year (Henderson et al., 2011; Shiels et al., 2004; Wang
et al., 2004). According to the study findings from LaMontagne et al. (2011), sick
leave due to physical and mental illness has cost Australian businesses between $11
billion and $12 billion annually in the past two decades.
    To address the seriousness of workplace mental health, the Australian federal
government has established the National Mentally Healthy Workplace Alliance to
promote workplace wellbeing across the country. The Alliance worked with univer-
sity scholars and psychologists to identify six key areas and strategies for creating
mentally healthy workplaces (Harvey et al., 2014). They include:

1.   Improving Work Design by:
     • creating flexibility around working hours and where, when, and how work
       is performed.
     • creating more opportunities for individuals and teams to be involved in
       decision-making processes.
     • meeting workplace health standards requirements to reduce risks to mental
       and physical injury.

2.   Building Better Work Cultures by:
     • providing training for leaders and supervisors including workplace mental
       health education.
     • ensuring senior staff are engaged in mental health promotion and maintaining
       a safe and positive climate.
     • developing, implementing, and monitoring a mental health policy which
       includes zero tolerance of bullying and discrimination.
     • ensuring that change is managed in an inclusive manner with open and
       realistic communication.

3.   Building Resilience by:
     • providing stress management and resilience training for those in high-risk
       jobs.
     • providing stress management and resilience training with evidence-based
       approaches, such as cognitive behavioural therapy.
     • creating a workplace that provides opportunities for regular physical activity.
     • providing mentoring and coaching to staff.

4.   Planning and Implementing Early Intervention by:
     • promoting and facilitating staff to seek help early.
     • conducting wellbeing checks and put in place appropriate support and
       resources.
210                                                            9 Workplace Emotions

      • offering Employee Assistance Programs which use experienced staff and
        evidence-based methods.
      • providing mental health training across the organisation (workplace) so all
        staff can help to support each other.
      • providing a peer-support program for staff.

5.    Supporting Recovery by:
      • providing training programs for leaders and supervisors on how to support
        workers’ recovery from mental illness and during stressful life events.
      • facilitating flexible sick leave arrangements; providing return-to-work
        programs.
      • modifying job/work schedules or duty rosters where appropriate.
      • ensuring that those with a history of mental illness are not discriminated
        against.
      • Increasing awareness by:
      • providing access to mental health information and resources.
      • conducting regular mental health awareness programs and training.
      • including mental health education in staff induction and staff development.
      • actively engaging in R U OK. Day and World Mental Health Day.

Over the past decade, numerous scholars interested in organisational and work-
place wellbeing have investigated the types of intervention provided by business
organisations, government organisations and not-for-profit organisations, and their
effectiveness. For example, Haby et al. (2016) conducted a systemic review of inter-
ventions to facilitate sustainable jobs and health sector workplaces. They found that
interventions that had positive impact on staff health include elements such as:
• enforcement of occupational health and safety regulations.
• provision of flexible working arrangements that increase worker control and
  choice.
• implementation of certain operational changes to shift work schedules.
• use of employee participation schemes.
• In contrast, interventions with negative impacts on health include:
• restrictions or downsizing.
• temporary and insecure work arrangements.
• outsourced or home-based work arrangements.
• some forms of task restructuring.
Moen et al. (2011) looked at organisational interventions designed to increase flex-
ibility and support for IT workers in the USA. In a longitudinal study spanning
twelve months, they found that increased employee control over work time and
greater supervisor support for workers’ personal lives reduced burnout and perceived
stress, and increased job satisfaction. The study demonstrates that organisations can
promote employee wellbeing with a rigorous work design at the organisation level.
In Holland, Meyers and Van Woerkom (2017) studied the use of ‘strengths interven-
tions’. Such interventions explored matching employees with tasks based on their
9.7 Workplace Wellbeing                                                           211

strengths, talents, interests and experience to achieve organisational goals, offering
more choices in the nature of work, increasing employees’ engagement, sense of
achievement and job satisfaction, and enhancing their independence and resilience.
The study found that such practice created short-term increases in employee positive
affect, and both short- and long-term increases in psychological wellbeing. Daniels
et al. (2017) examined thirty-three intervention studies on job design, a process of
coordinating and optimising work processes to maximise performance. The authors
found huge improvements in staff wellbeing and performance when effective training
was coupled with job design.
   Lloyd et al. (2017) found that stress management training given to UK government
employees increased their levels of intrinsic work motivation. They discovered that
guided e-learning health promotion interventions for managers based on management
standards for the improvement of employee welling were able to reduce leaves of
absence due to sickness. And De Bloom et al. (2012) noted that when workers
were given longer lunch breaks to take a walk in a park, they were able to mentally
detach from their work for a while, relax and recover, leading to reduced fatigue and
increased job satisfaction.
   Ebert et al. (2015) conducted a trial to evaluate the efficacy of an Internet-based
intervention for American teachers, which aimed to help them to recover from
work-related strain and reduce sleeping problems and work-related rumination. They
found moderate improvement among 128 participating teachers with insomnia, and
concluded that such programs can have a positive impact on the mental health of
teachers who are stressed.
   Resilience programs and interventions are also common in many organisational
and workplace wellbeing initiatives. Robertson et al.(2015) directed a systematic
review of work-based resilience training interventions. They found that people
responded differently to such training and the benefits were evident depending on
how resilience was defined, conceptualised, developed and assessed. This notion is
backed by the meta-analysis of Theeboom et al. (2014), who found that coaching
is more effective in helping employees develop needed workplace resilience, espe-
cially in areas like work attitude, job performance skills, coping, and goal-directed
self-regulation. They also found that providing staff with mindfulness intervention
increased their resilience and workplace wellbeing.
   Meyers et al. (2013) investigated the effectiveness of positive psychology inter-
ventions applied in the organisational context. These interventions involved culti-
vating of respect and appreciation for co-workers, embracing creativity, making use
of mentoring and coaching to support employees, and helping employees to develop
a positive mindset focused on strengths rather than deficits. The study concluded that
such interventions seemed to diminish stress and burnout, and could be considered
promising tools for promoting employee wellbeing.
   This chapter has stated the importance of EI in the workplace and illustrated what
constitutes workplace stress and conflict, how organisational climate can affect our
thoughts, emotions and behaviour, and how the perception of organisational politics
affects our performance and productivity. It has also discussed challenges people face
with workplace bullying and the reasons for these bullying behaviours. The author

hopes that readers can look at workplace challenges from these perspectives and
become more aware of these stressors, and be prepared to face and cope with them
by developing a higher level of workplace EI. Chapter 12 will present some practical
guides and strategies to help readers to become more self- and other-aware, establish
healthy boundaries, develop helpful responses, take time to recharge and learn how
to relax, and most important of all, seek help and gain support when needed.

EI and Work-Life Balance




10.1 Introduction

Our lives can be characterised as a complex fabric woven out of events and activities
driven by our needs, wants and interests, which lead to both pleasure and pressure.
We all desire a happy and fulfilled life. Some scholars claim that our happiness is
under our own control. A balanced life is not elusive at all if we understand ourselves
better, become more aware of our environments, pay attention to our relationships
and know how to use our strengths, and emotional intelligence.
    This chapter looks at how the demands of our work, study and family and social
responsibilities shape our levels of happiness and peace of mind through what’s called
‘work-life balance’. It draws on empirical studies to discuss how people understand
and explain work-life balance using different theories, and what factors determine
work-life balance. It presents data to illustrate what work-life balance means for
different groups of people, including married couples, single dads and single mums.
It also describes, based on research evidence, how students in different age groups
struggle to create work-study-family balance. These include school-aged students,
domestic and international university students, and mature-age students with different
family responsibilities and demands. Finally, it gives some coping strategies and
recommendations to help readers gain insight into how they can manage their own
work-life balance.



10.2 What Is Work-Life Balance?

In today’s fast-paced society, diligence is regarded as an asset. Many of us burn the
midnight oil and put in overtime to gain recognition, promotions and bonuses, and
to satisfy our desires to be respected, earn more money, climb the corporate ladder
and achieve desired success. Studies have provided evidence that we are working
harder and for longer hours and becoming more ‘time-poor’ and unable to attend

to other aspects of our lives, which is leading to work-family conflict, physical and
mental health issues, and work-life balance issues (Bacharach et al., 1991; Jennings &
McDougald, 2007; Kang et al., 2010).
   Kalliath and Brough (2008) identified six definitions of work-life balance that are
commonly used in the literature. According to them, work-life balance:
• is about people having a measure of control over when, where and how they work.
• reflects an individual’s orientation across different life roles.
• is about the extent to which an individual is engaged in—and equally satisfied
  with—their work and family roles.
• is about achieving a satisfying experience in all life domains, and requires personal
  resources such as energy, time and commitment to be well distributed across
  domains.
• is the extent to which an individual’s effectiveness and satisfaction in work and
  family roles are compatible with their life role priorities at a given point in time.
• is about having low levels of inter-role conflict and high levels of inter-role
  facilitation, which contribute to higher levels of perceived work-family balance.


10.2.1 Factors Determining Work-Life Balance

Achieving work-life balance is not easy but it is achievable—and important. The
consequences of work-life imbalance can cause our health to deteriorate, increase
strain in our personal relationships, and reduce our work productivity, but when we
understand how and why these imbalances occur, we may be able to avoid their
detrimental effects.
   Studies in the work-life balance literature have identified numerous personal
factors that can contribute to work-life imbalance. These include our gender, age
and stage in our life cycle, personality, education level, marital status, parental status
and family responsibilities.
Gender:                       Scholars have found that men and women tend to priori-
                              tise work and family roles differently, with women
                              assuming the majority of childcare duties and men
                              generally taking on the breadwinning role and devoting
                              more time to work (Haworth & Lewis, 2005; Jennings &
                              McDougald, 2007). However, women who take on
                              part-time jobs as a secondary income source some-
                              times experience conflict between their work and family
                              commitments (Drew, 2005).
Age and life-cycle stage:     In an earlier study, Bardwick (1986) noted that indi-
                              viduals learn to attain work-life balance as they mature
                              and gain age, experience and expectations. Wang et al.
                              (2010) also reported that older adults report greater
                              success in achieving work-life balance. Some scholars,

                             however, have observed that many individuals born in
                             the 1970s (also known as Generation X) have a better
                             sense of work-life balance and actively seek types of
                             employment that suit their lifestyles in order to gain a
                             healthy work-life balance (Cogin, 2012; Gursoy et al.,
                             2008).
Personality differences:     Individuals have unique personalities, values, emotions
                             and moods, which all affect how they view work and
                             work-life balance. Some people are able to draw clear
                             boundaries between work and life, while others struggle
                             to find balance because they think about life and family
                             while they work, and about work while they are with
                             their family and friends. While some feel guilty about
                             working too hard and not meeting the needs of their
                             family, others are happy to satisfy their basic psycho-
                             logical needs for autonomy, competence, growth and
                             creativity, and the pursuit of career success. Individuals
                             who show a personality characteristic of ‘openness’ are
                             best able to strike an optimal balance between work and
                             life, while those viewed as having a ‘neurotic’ person-
                             ality type are more vulnerable to work-life imbalance
                             (Bekker et al., 2010).
Education level:             One study suggests that work-life balance is greater
                             among those with high-school graduation levels and
                             lower, while those with undergraduate or advanced
                             university degrees tend to have more work-life balance
                             issues. However, among individuals with advanced
                             degrees, those with more work experience and a high
                             level of self-confidence and self-efficacy tend to be more
                             skilled in maintaining work-life balance (Chong & Ma,
                             2010).
Marital status:              Some studies have found that married people found it
                             harder to establish separation between their work and
                             family lives and experience more work-life conflict than
                             those who are unmarried (Hall & Richter, 1988; Martins
                             et al., 2002).
Parental status:             People in parental roles also found it harder to balance
                             the roles and demands of their work and family lives.
                             Many showed a tendency to struggle with balancing
                             household demands, family commitments, spousal
                             support and work stress (Blau et al., 1998). In a compar-
                             ative study, Tausig and Fenwick (2001) found that
                             couples without children reported a greater sense of
                             work-life balance than those with children.

Family responsibility:   Warren (2004) showed that family responsibility
                         and the family environment can also affect work-
                         life balance. For example, an individual’s finan-
                         cial resources, dwelling, neighbourhood, support from
                         extended family, social support from friends and
                         community, and state of health are all factors that can
                         influence the state of their work-life balance. The nature
                         of our jobs and employment and our work environ-
                         ment can also play a key part in the balancing act that
                         is finding work-life equilibrium. These factors include
                         work demands, work characteristics, personal moti-
                         vation, performance standards, organisational (work-
                         place) culture, work flexibility, and social support.
Work demand:             Both employees and business owners face challenges in
                         terms of work demands. High-demand tasks can include
                         long working hours, high workloads, intense emotional
                         effort in responding to distressing situations, and expo-
                         sure to traumatic events or work-related conflict (or even
                         violence). These can lead to high exertion of mental or
                         physical energy, emotional stress and adverse psycho-
                         physiological consequences that can impact the quality
                         of personal and family life (White et al., 2003). Individ-
                         uals with less control over their work generally report
                         higher role overload and tension between their work and
                         family roles.
Work characteristics:    Studies have found that people working in occupations
                         that demand frequent interactions with others, a lot of
                         people in management and multiple work roles found it
                         harder to maintain work-life balance (Judge & Colquitt,
                         2004). Work factors such as job autonomy, flexibility in
                         scheduling and work hours and the amount of support
                         received in the workplace also contribute to work-life
                         balance or imbalance (Chong & Ma, 2010).
Personal motivation:     Some people are motivated intrinsically; that is, by
                         their desire to seek enjoyment, growth, fulfilment,
                         novelty and excitement through work. Some are moti-
                         vated extrinsically; that is, by the opportunity for gain,
                         whether that gain is monetary or in the form of social
                         status, recognition and power. Studies have found that
                         people who are driven by intrinsic motivation are more
                         able and willing to manage their work-life balance than
                         those who are extrinsically motivated (Alexandris et al.,
                         2002; Meyer et al., 2004).
Performance standards:   Many workplaces and organisations have set perfor-
                         mance standards to ensure and improve employees’
10.2 What Is Work-Life Balance?                                                    223

                             performance. Mumford et al. (2002) found that when
                             employees are well supported in the workplace to
                             achieve these standards, they will find more job satis-
                             faction and fulfilment; those who are not are more likely
                             to feel stressed and lose their work-life balance.
Organisational culture:      Organisational (or workplace) culture can also create a
                             drive for high performance and job satisfaction. When
                             employees feel respected, valued and supported with
                             human and material resources, they feel less stressed
                             and find more joy in their work and their non-work-
                             related life (Maxwell & McDougall, 2004).
Work flexibility:            Work-related flexibility is important to organisational
                             leaders, business owners and employees. It relates to
                             the ability of the workplace to cope with changes and
                             enable workers and employees some choices in where,
                             when how and for how long they wish to work. Organi-
                             sations and well-planned small businesses can help their
                             employees to balance their work and family demands
                             by offering flexible work arrangements, flexi-time, job
                             sharing, shift work, working from home or other work
                             modes (Kara et al., 2002; Maxwell, 2005).
Social support:              Social support is a crucial resource to help people to
                             cope in times of stress and difficulties. People with
                             different support resources, such as support from co-
                             workers and community groups and different forms of
                             financial support (e.g., government subsidies), are able
                             to cope with life’s harsh challenges much more easily
                             (Cinamon & Rich, 2010; Martins et al., 2002).
Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is important both for the individual and for
businesses and organisations. Knowing how to prioritise our time and understanding
our own needs and those of our family will help us to find the balance we need.
Likewise, by supporting employees to find balance between their work lives and
family lives, businesses and organisations can gain through increased engagement,
commitment and work productivity. People who are happy in their workplace tend
to go the extra mile and become loyal and dedicated.



10.2.2 Theories on Work-Life Balance

As interest in work-life balance has grown in the last three decades, numerous theories
have been developed to help us recognise and identify problems, enrich our knowl-
edge and broaden our perspectives on the topic. Here are some theories associated
with work-life balance.
224                                                10 EI and Work-Life Balance

Work-life border theory:   This theory explains that even though our work
                           and family lives belong in different spheres, they
                           influence each other and are continually crossing
                           the complex ‘border’ between them. These
                           borders are physical (behaviour and actions),
                           psychological (thinking and behavioural patterns,
                           and emotions) and temporal (time required in
                           role-specific work). People make daily efforts
                           to shape each domain in order to create their
                           desired balance (Clark, 2000). Karassvidou and
                           Glaveli (2015) have provided empirical evidence
                           to explain these borders and found that many indi-
                           viduals struggle to cross the work-family border
                           because demands from the work domain are too
                           powerful and beyond their control.
Segmentation theory:       This theory assumes that every domain in our life
                           functions independently. It postulates that when
                           people are unhappy with their work, they can
                           leave their dissatisfaction behind them with the
                           workplace and not let it disturb them (Zedeck &
                           Mosier, 1990). Scholars subscribing to this theory
                           think that people can find balance if they can use
                           a segmentation approach to separate their work-
                           place demands and pressures from their personal
                           life and vice versa in order to find balance and
                           harmony (Edwards & Rothbard, 2000).
Compensation theory:       This theory was first introduced by Piotrkowski
                           (1979), who observed that workers who felt dissat-
                           isfied with their work tended to redirect their ener-
                           gies towards their home lives. Subsequent theories
                           have postulated that when someone feels unful-
                           filled at work, they tend to seek compensation
                           and balance at home (Lambert, 1990; Young &
                           Kleiner, 1992). Others have found that people who
                           are not satisfied with their work become disen-
                           gaged and put their energy into their family life
                           or other interests, such as sports, art, music and
                           other hobbies, to gain satisfaction and balance.
                           Likewise, if they are unfulfilled with their family
                           life, people can transform into workaholics and
                           seek balance by keeping busy and creating job
                           demands (Edwards & Rothbard, 2000).
Boundary theory:           This theory explains how people assign mean-
                           ings to their work life and non-work life, and
                           how they transition between these roles (Ashforth
10.2 What Is Work-Life Balance?                                                   225

                                  et al., 2000). It uses a segmentation-integration
                                  continuum to illustrate how some people view role
                                  boundaries as flexible and permeable, while others
                                  are segmented. Some people enjoy work and do
                                  not see it as an interference in their family lives.
                                  For them, their work-life boundary is blurred, as
                                  they can happily ‘integrate’ demands from both
                                  domains, whereas on the extreme other side of
                                  the spectrum, ‘segmentors’ are not able to mix
                                  work life with non-work life, and find it inap-
                                  propriate or distracting. For example, individ-
                                  uals who are more on the ‘segmentor’ side of
                                  the spectrum would prefer to use ‘flexi-time’ to
                                  meet work and parental demands, whereas a more
                                  ‘integration-minded’ individual would welcome
                                  on-site childcare facilities in the workplace. Like-
                                  wise, some people enjoy working from home,
                                  while others need to be in the formal work-
                                  place (office) to function optimally. Today, many
                                  corporations and government organisations have
                                  learned to use boundary management strategies
                                  to help their staff manage the critical bound-
                                  aries between their multiple life domains and find
                                  balance (Rothbard & Ollier-Malaterre, 2015).
Work-life enrichment theory:      This social-cognitive theory proposes that work
                                  and family lives can interfere with one another
                                  as well as enhancing quality of life (Green-
                                  haus & Powell, 2006). It suggests that enrich-
                                  ment occurs through two pathways, the instru-
                                  mental and the affective. Many people can benefit
                                  from investing expanded energy in their work to
                                  find joy in their family life. For example, an indi-
                                  vidual can utilise people skills and work insights
                                  to manage family and social relationships (instru-
                                  mental benefit), and when they find fulfilment
                                  at home, they will also contribute more at work
                                  with their positive emotions and mental energy
                                  (affective benefit). Likewise, when people find
                                  love and joy at home, they are likely to become
                                  more compassionate with their co-workers and
                                  build better social and interpersonal relationships.
                                  Empirical evidence has confirmed that work-life
                                  enrichment is positively linked to job related atti-
                                  tudes such as increased job satisfaction, decreased

                                   ical and mental health (Baral & Bhargava, 2010;
                                   McNall et al., 2010; Russo & Buonocore, 2012).
Ecological systems theory:         This theory, developed by Bronfenbrenner (1994),
                                   considers the ecological environment as a set
                                   of nested structures and systems that impact on
                                   the growth and development of the individual.
                                   These systems include microsystems (the imme-
                                   diate environment where an individual develops
                                   personal identity, social roles and interpersonal
                                   relationships), the mesosystem (the school and
                                   community environments, and the people in
                                   these environments, which shape the person’s
                                   thoughts and values), the macrosystem (the
                                   culture and values surrounding a person), and
                                   the chronosystem (the passage of time and how
                                   it transforms the person). Scholars contributing
                                   to work-life balance research have applied this
                                   theory to broaden our understanding of work-life
                                   balance through a systems lens, which includes
                                   social context, passage of time and personal
                                   characteristics (Voydanoff, 2005).
A growing number of organisations have made use of these theories and related
strategies to help their employees manage their work-life balance. These strategies
have been developed into organisational policies and included in their education,
training and development agendas (Beauregard & Henry, 2009).



10.3 Work-Life Balance and Parenthood

Today’s working parents face a juggling act, blending work and life to create a balance
between their professional and family lives. Contemporary researchers have found
that many young parents experience difficulties in balancing work and caring for
their children. This feeling of imbalance impacts on their employment and relation-
ships, and lowers their performance standards and productivity (Aggarwal, 2012;
Culbertson et al., 2012). Some studies have found that there is no gender difference,
and that both male and female parents faced imbalances in their family and work
lives (Doble & Supriya, 2010). Many are able to find peace and an increase in their
job satisfaction and performance when given support in the workplace in forms such
as flexi-hours, opportunities to work from home, part-time work options and policies
allowing flexi-time and emergency leave to attend to family crises (Asadullah &
Fernández, 2008). The following sections describe the different challenges working
couples face and the different circumstances they face as parents.
10.3 Work-Life Balance and Parenthood                                               227

10.3.1 Working Parents and Work-Life Balance

Parenting has never been easy. Many contemporary couples find balancing the dual
demands of work and parenting a challenge. Studies in the new millennium have
revealed that many parents find their work experiences have a significant impact
on their parenting behaviour and the overall quality of their family life. Some are
turning to harsher parenting styles due to their emotional responses to work pressures,
work overload, long working hours and negative workplace environments (Crouter &
Bumpus, 2001). They have reduced parent–child interactions and less leisure to
enjoy quality family time and to bond with their children and build positive family
relationships. This is especially true for shift workers and those who need to work
during holidays and weekends (Cho, 2018; Perry-Jenkins et al., 2017).
    Research has established that parents who experience high levels of work-family
conflict are more likely to have lower-quality parent–child connections that are
marred by irritability, insensitivity and inconsistent parenting behaviour (Cooklin
et al., 2016). Many of these parents reported low parenting efficacy and low parental
satisfaction (Cinamon et al., 2007; Vieira et al., 2012). Using the border theory, Clark
(2000) has explained that in order to strike a balance, people need to understand,
negotiate and manage both the work and family spheres and the borders between
them. He describes three kinds of border: the physical (the workplace location and
environment), the temporal (work hours and demands), and the psychological (the
individual’s thinking patterns, behaviour and emotions).
    The workplace environment can be both physical and non-physical. The physical
components includes its size (spacious or crowded), ergonomics (functional design,
furniture, atmosphere, ventilation) and ambience (quiet or noisy, good or bad air
quality, presence of indoor plants and decor to lift moods). The non-physical compo-
nents can include its climate and culture (general mood, work relationships, policies
and procedures, professional and social supports). As for location, naturally, the
closer to home the better. If one has to drive over an hour and tolerate heavy traffic
and road pollution to get to work and home again, it will impact one’s mood and
health in the long run.
    The time demands of work can take a toll on an individual’s physical and mental
health. High levels of work-time demand and long work hours have been found to
negatively impact workers’ health and wellbeing (Albertsen et al., 2008; Hughes &
Parkes, 2007), and are linked to increased work-family conflict (Hosking & Western,
2008).
    Psychological factors that influence work-family conflict can include lack of role
clarity, poor person-job fit, career development issues (e.g., promotion opportuni-
ties; lack of job security), relationship issues (e.g., lack of support from supervi-
sors), repetitive and monotonous work, harassment, discrimination and problems
with organisational structure and climate such as low level of perceived control over
work tasks, office politics, tight schedules and deadlines, poor communication, etc.
    Three American studies reported that work-family conflict led to poor eating
habits and an increased consumption of unhealthy food, and heavy alcohol use for
228                                                      10 EI and Work-Life Balance

some people. These studies also found that work-family conflict was associated
with negative outcomes, including increased stress symptoms and decreased life
satisfaction (Adams et al., 1996; Grandey & Cropanzano, 1999; Hammer et al.,
2004).
   Many families today still adhere to the traditional norm of the male being the
key breadwinner and the woman being charged with domestic responsibilities, even
when she works and contributes to the family’s income. While some people experi-
ence work-to-family conflict, many others therefore also experience family-to-work
conflict. Factors found to lead to such conflicts include childcare and household
chores, marital tensions, number of children, family financial situation, personality
differences within the household, and family support network (Bellavia & Frone,
2005). A UK study found that women preferred working from home (e.g., as tele-
workers) because their jobs allowed them to perform multiple roles and continue to
fulfil their domestic responsibilities, while men preferred to work away from home
as it allowed them to separate work from family life (Sullivan & Lewis, 2001).
   Social psychologists believe that work-life balance differs at different stages of
parenthood. Wepfer et al. (2018) divided their study subjects into five distinctive
family-life stages:
   Stage 1: young adults without children.
   Stage 2: parents of pre-schoolers.
   Stage 3: parents with primary-school children.
   Stage 4: parents of children older than age 12.
   Stage 5: parents with grown children.
They found that men experienced significantly higher work demands than women
in all of these family stages, as most were the main breadwinners of the family.
They also found that both work and family demands were at their highest in Stages
2 and 3, and women reported significantly more demands on them than men did.
These women felt more responsible for their children, and in addition to their work
demands, they felt pressure in childcare-related matters. Though many more men
have been found to be more involved in caring for their children nowadays, this
study found that most men’s involvement with their children was recreational and
leisure-related. Stage 5 parenthood reported the greatest sense of work-life balance,
as their children were grown and they had more experience of life and how to cope
with demands coming from different angles (Wepfer et al., 2018).
    In order to strike a balance and overcome work-family conflict, one has to be
conscious of what balance entails. Greenhaus et al. (2003) point out that when one is
mindful of time balance (devoting equal time to both work and family), involvement
balance (maintaining equal levels of psychological involvement in both work and
family roles) and satisfaction balance (how one defines and obtains satisfaction from
work and family life), then work-life balance can be achieved. Learning to become
more self-aware and mindful of these roles and role demands will be helpful for
those who need more work-life balance.

10.3.2 Single Parents and Work-Life Balance

Single parenthood is becoming more common these days. The reasons for a person
becoming a single parent include the death of a spouse, a divorce or relationship
breakdown, or a single woman choosing to raise a child alone. Today, more and
more women are choosing to give birth to or adopt a child while remaining a single
parent.
   It appears to be a common practice in the USA and some other parts of the world
for mothers to get primary custody of the children in a divorce while most fathers
become non-custodial parents (Flood, 2010). Co-parenting is still a relatively rare
practice in the US (Doucet, 2006), whereas joint custody is more common in Canada.
Statistics from the Canadian Department of Justice show that between 2014 and 2015,
65% of divorcing mothers and 10% of divorcing fathers received sole custody, while
12% received joint or shared custody of their children (Canadian Department of
Justice, 2021). The literature informs us that single parenthood impacts men and
women differently.
   Fathers in the new millennium tend to demonstrate greater involvement with their
children than previous generations (Cowan et al., 2009). A growing number of studies
found that children of highly engaged fathers show more positive social, emotional
and cognitive development. These fathers are also found to be more patient, flexible,
emotionally responsive and sensitive to their children. They tend to demonstrate
more self-confidence, find more satisfaction in their bonds with their children and
are intrinsically motivated to be with their children. However, Flood (2010) also
found that in some cases, fathers’ involvement with their children can be heavily
impacted by a mother with full custodial rights, which divorced fathers referred to as
‘the maternal gatekeeper’. When a divorce is amicable, the father-children connection
is more likely to be harmonious, whereas when a marriage has ended in a hostile and
unforgiving manner, the children may be used by one parent—or both—as weapons
against the other.



10.3.3 Challenges Faced by Single Dads

People tend to pay attention to the struggles of single mums, and not much has
been written about how single dads and fathers without custodial rights face their
challenges. But men who suffer relational losses endure the same amount of pain as
their spouses, and losing their children can be devastating for some men.
    Divorce is often a heart-breaking and stressful process, and in many cases it can
be brutal for men who struggle with the sudden loss of their identity as the family
provider, the involved father, the husband. Some of them see themselves as having
‘failed’ as a man, and feel that they are being judged by their community for the
failure of their marriage the breakdown of their family (Doucet, 2006). For some,
losing custody of their children also means an additional financial burden, as they
230                                                        10 EI and Work-Life Balance

have to pay child support, and possibly alimony, on top of the increased cost of living
as a single person. These experiences and demands can take a toll on their physical,
psychological and emotional balance.
    Men can become single fathers due to divorce, the death of their spouse or the
children’s mother abandoning them (Goldscheider et al., 2013). Both Eastern and
Western societies generally identify the mother as the primary caretaker and the father
as the financial provider and disciplinarian (Biblarz & Stacey, 2010). However, many
more fathers are readily accepting emotional as well as financial responsibility for
their children now, and so, in addition to having to face the juggling act of managing
emotional demands and work demands, single fathers also have to face the new
demands of playing the dual roles of mum and dad at the same time.
    Literature studying the challenges faced by single fathers is still rare. The most
common discussions focus on the difficulties fathers experience when raising daugh-
ters. These studies have found that single fathers tend to feel more equipped to
raise sons and deal with the developmental stages of their same-gender child, and
find it more challenging to meet the needs of their daughters (e.g., Lee & Kushner,
2008). However, some scholars have found that men who demonstrate a strong desire
to accept this responsibility and to become a ‘good father’ soon learn to develop
‘maternal capacities’ (Biblarz & Stacey, 2010). Bronte-Tinkew et al. (2010) found
that many single fathers seem to employ a broadminded parenting style, characterised
by responsiveness, acceptance and affirmation, and sometimes, a bit too permissive.
On the other hand, those without support from extended family are less able to meet
the recreational needs of their children, such as for sports and out-of-school educa-
tional programs. Some studies also note that single fathers generally experience less
economic stress than single mothers (Bronte-Tinkew et al., 2010), but that those
without social support tend to become overwhelmed by the demands of the house-
hold tasks and obligations they have to complete every day (Östberg & Hagekull,
2013). While parenting may look different depending on demographics, the reality
is that children require a particular level of care from their caretaker, whoever that
is, in order to function in society, and many single fathers experience an imbalance
in their work-family balance due to the multiple roles they have to play (Lawson,
2012).



10.3.4 Challenges Faced by Single Mums

Women became single mothers for a range of reasons, including being widowed,
having an unplanned pregnancy, and going through a relationship break-up or divorce.
In addition, some single mothers choose to be single parents by having or adopting
a child alone. Challenges faced by single mums can be different in some ways from
those faced by single dads. Research data have shown that single mothers experience
more stressful life events compared to married mothers, as well as more mental
health issues, and are more likely to have low psychological wellbeing. They also
indicate that single mums aged 45–50 are likely to be four times worse off financially
10.3 Work-Life Balance and Parenthood                                              231

than married mothers (Craig, 2007; Loxton et al., 2006). The gender gap in work
and pay in many Western societies, where despite having higher levels of education,
women earn less than men in general, adds to the challenges faced by single mums.
Correspondingly, stress leading to work-life imbalance can come from role overload,
as single mothers without financial child support become the sole financial providers
for their families, and have to cope with both being the sole nurturer and carer for
the children, and meeting work and household demands (Bird, 1997; Lucas, 2007).
Unmarried single mothers also have to deal with stigmatisation and societal and
cultural acceptance in some cultures, including Asian cultures (Rudowicz, 2001).
    Financial difficulties remain a key challenge for many women across the globe.
According to the Australian Council of Social Services (2018), 32% of single parents
(mums or dads) live in poverty, 59% of single-parent households rely on government
assistance as their main source of income, 72% of single mothers have children
under the age of 10, and 88.5% of jobless families are headed by single mothers.
Half of these unemployed mothers also have health issues or are caring for children
with disability or special needs. The financial difficulties faced by these mothers
include non-payment of child support from divorced fathers who fail to support their
children. Accordingly, custodial parents who do not receive financial support from
their ex-partners tend to be socioeconomically disadvantaged (Dinh et al., 2017).
    Many single-mum families living in poverty lack the resources to meet their basic
needs. As a result, they face physical and mental health challenges and may experi-
ence extreme imbalance in their family lives. As a result, children may be neglected or
abused, show behavioural and emotional problems, and have difficulties with school
engagement and attendance, leading to poor education and employment outcomes.
Many are also excluded from extracurricular activities and leisure activities (Gault
et al., 2018).
    A 2017 Australian Salvation Army report notes that average single-mum house-
holds spend 64% of their income on rent and living accommodation. More of these
families are therefore at risk of being homeless, and despite governmental assistance,
some children also face food insecurity. Mothers who are unemployed survive on
an average of $14.35 a day after paying utilities and housing expenses. Children
living in such underprivileged circumstances are more likely to develop behavioural
and emotional problems, especially when their mother is unable to cope with all the
demands on her.



10.3.5 Supporting Single Parents in Finding
       Work-Life Balance

Solo parenting is not just challenging; it can be an ordeal for many. Knowing how to
find help and support is the key to maintaining a more balanced family life for both
the parent and their children. In addition to dealing with the grief associated with
the loss of a spouse or partner, whether to death or to separation, the single parent
232                                                          10 EI and Work-Life Balance

needs to maintain their own wellbeing in order to look after the children. Below are
some recommendations from the Australian National Council for Single Mothers
and Their Children and the Father’s Rights Law Centre to assist with doing so.
   At the personal level:
• Establish routines to help yourself and your children to find balance: By creating
  steps to simplify daily routines, parents can help themselves and their kids to stop
  feeling overwhelmed, especially in stressful times. Organisation techniques such
  as setting up routines for daily, weekly and monthly chores can ease worries and
  reduce unnecessary stress.
• Set aside time for your kids: In addition to meeting work demands and household
  demands, it is important to set aside some time each day to attend to the needs
  of the kids. If it is impossible to do this daily, at least plan to do so a few times a
  week. Spending quality time with the kids can help both parents and children to
  relax, bond, enjoy each other’s company and renew their energy.
• Ditch the guilt: Life is particularly tough on single parents. It is therefore important
  to prioritise. Most single parents feel guilty when they cannot find more time to
  spend with their kids, and this feeling of guilt can add up, leading to mental health
  issues. Single parents must learn to forgive themselves if they are not able to do
  everything. By seeking help, they may be able to find support resources among
  family, friends and even neighbours that can help them meet their kids’ social or
  educational needs.
• Frequently reflect on your own wellbeing and develop positive habits to support
  yourself: It can be helpful for single parents to seek help from friends, family and
  professional counsellors to talk about their problems and release tension. So can
  establishing routines to maintain good physical and mental health, e.g., by going
  for a walk, listening to calming music or engage in meditation, and refraining
  from self-denial and negative thoughts.
• Understand your financial state and organise your finances: It is important for
  single parents to be realistic about their financial state and needs, to create a
  budget and, if possible, to set aside some savings. Taking some time to find out
  where they can get financial assistance to meet their family’s needs is also helpful.
• Seek support from your work organisation: Single parents should never feel
  ashamed or embarrassed about talking to their workplace management to seek
  help. Options such as working flexi-hours and negotiating flexible working
  arrangements can enable them to maintain a healthier work-life balance and have
  time to look after the kids.


10.3.6 At the Social, Community and Governmental Level

There are increasing amounts of support provided by governments, charity organ-
isations and community groups to assist single-parent households in meeting their
needs. Such assistance comes in the form of welfare payments, training and develop-
ment to help parents upskill so they can find better jobs. There may also be financial
10.3 Work-Life Balance and Parenthood                                             233

support including free or reduced rates for medical care, subsidies for childcare and
afterschool care, food donations, donations of toys, clothing and household goods,
and so on. However, the biggest and most challenging factor that is increasingly
impacting single-parent households, and other low-income family households, is
housing access. Due to property investors and governmental unwillingness to regu-
late ever-increasing property costs, low-income families and young adults are finding
it hard to afford even rental accommodation. As a result, homelessness has become
a global phenomenon.
    Poverty is a wicked problem—one that is complex, dynamic, evolving and seem-
ingly unsolvable. However, it is still the responsibility of every government to look
after their citizens’ wellbeing. More people need to step up and advocate for more
input from both the government and the community to solve problems that lead
to extreme poverty and human suffering. People need to become advocates for the
disadvantaged, and governments need to prioritise their citizens instead of serving
the rich and their political sponsors.
    Parenting is hard. Solo parenting is even harder. However, parents must always be
responsible for their children and make sure that they are cared for and supported, so
that they can grow and develop without interruptions. When people are mindful of
what good parenting is, they naturally do their best for their children. But knowing
how to prioritise and reduce stress is essential; no one can achieve perfect work-
life balance all the time, so sometimes we need to develop strategies to manage the
discomfort brought about by competing demands instead.



10.4 Work-Life Balance for Students

In today’s demanding world, many students as young as sixteen have to work part-
time to meet their personal and family financial needs. A majority of university
students, both domestic and international, also need to work to pay for both living
expenses and study-related costs. Juggling their work, study and family life demands
means that many endure imbalance and mental stress caused by their competing
obligations. Finding work-life balance is especially challenging for international
students studying in a foreign country. Married couples and parents engaging in
adult education and higher degrees also face difficulties maintaining equilibrium
in their lives as they wrestle with the demands of their studies, work, and family
responsibilities. The following sections discuss how these demands affect different
groups of students.

10.4.1 Study and Life Balance for Schoolchildren
       and Adolescents

Contemporary studies disclose that youth in both Western and Eastern cultures suffer
mental health issues related to the transition from childhood to adolescence. The
WHO 2014 report shows that many adolescents experience mental health challenges
leading to anxiety and depression during this life-stage transition. Other studies have
provided evidence that teenagers who are unable to find balance in their life are more
likely to pursue risky behaviours such as smoking, drinking and drug use, and to
experience suicidal thoughts and behaviours (Feld & Shusterman, 2015; Finkelstein
et al., 2006).
    Many Asian research studies have also provided evidence that younger children
suffer anxiety due to the demands on them to perform well and compete with their
peers at school. This pressure is felt even in primary school, and especially in the
final year of primary school when parents expect their children to earn places in
elite and esteemed high schools (Zhang, 2014). While many of their counterparts in
the West do not experience similar academic stress (Bjorkman, 2007), many Asian
teens, especially in China, experience tremendous amounts of academic stress that
leads to mental health issues. This is especially so among students in the final year
of high school, and those who attained lower grades in their school exams (Xu et al.,
2014; Zhang, 2014). In countries including Korea, China, and Singapore, teachers
and parents tend to blame students for not meeting academic requirements instead
of helping them, causing feelings of low self-esteem, insecurity and anxiety (Ang &
Huan, 2006; Zhou et al., 2012). As a result, many students have difficulty sleeping,
live with self-blame and guilt and lose interest in everything; some can gain weight
and some contemplate committing suicide (Zhu et al., 2014).
    Luo et al. (2014) have shown that students from lower-income families reported
higher levels of depression related to both academic stress and family-life stress.
The educational levels and psychological behaviours of their parents also impacted
these young people and how they responded to academic stress. In addition, the
marital status of their parents affected the work-study-life balance of students, in
both Eastern and Western cultures. Some students were able to create balance thanks
to peer support, especially when they were able to establish a sense of belonging
with and acceptance by their peers. For example, students who formed study groups
were able to support one another and find a better work-study balance, and were less
prone to the academic stress that many of their peers endured (Carman & Zhang,
2008; Haynie, 2002).
    Cultural demands are hard to deal with and often manifest as wicked problems.
For centuries, Asian children have been burdened with pressure to perform well
at school. It is unlikely that such generational weight can be lifted or abolished.
However, when parents, teachers and educational policy makers become mindful of
the situation and develop more empathy, they may be able to help their students to
cope better and maintain a better work-study-life balance.

10.4.2 Study-Work-Family Demands on University Students

Today, more young people are pursuing university degrees and higher education
after completing high school. However, the cost of higher education is skyrocketing
in many advanced countries, including the UK, the US and Australia. Many students
need to work part-time to make ends meet. In a comprehensive study, Mclnnis and
Hartley (2002) made the following observations about students in higher education
(universities and TAFE) in Australia, noting that:
• a majority of working students (75%) depended on paid work as a major source
  of income; 23% of students reported paid work as a minor source of income, and
  only 3% reported that paid work was not a source at all.
• students from lower social-economic backgrounds have greater access to income
  support than those from middle-class backgrounds.
• one in five students from the middle-class group took up part-time work to meet
  entertainment and personal consumption needs (e.g., buying clothes, going on
  holidays).
• students from higher socio-economic backgrounds had higher rates of participa-
  tion in university and educational activities because they did not need to work to
  make ends meet. Many of them believed that having a part-time job would distract
  them from their studies and university life.
• students under the age of 25 tended to find part-time work, while older students
  were more likely to prioritise their studies.
On top of meeting their financial needs while studying, other social demands can
also take a toll on students in their young adulthood, including gaining indepen-
dence, learning to establish trust in the adult world, managing emotions in romantic
relationships and friendships, and trying to establish a career path.



10.4.3 Study-Work-Family Demands on International
       Students

As a result of globalisation, studying overseas has become a common trend. Like
their domestic counterparts, international students studying in foreign universities
need to take up part-time work to make ends meet. Some of the factors that can
impact their sense of balance include culture shock, homesickness, language and
communication barriers, a lack of a sense of belonging and the absence of social
support.
   Research has also shown that international students face an increased risk of expe-
riencing anxiety and other mental illnesses compared to domestic students. These risk
factors include social and cultural isolation in a new country, financial stress, culture
shock, high expectations and performance pressures, language and communication
barriers, and difficulties in adjusting to a new academic system. Some international
236                                                       10 EI and Work-Life Balance

students also report fear and perceived threats to their safety in relation to theft,
workplace exploitation, race-related assault, religious differences and communica-
tion barriers. Due to these challenges, many international students are unable to
establish social support networks to help them settle down and balance their work-
study demands. A number of them still rely on digital communication with their
family overseas for support, emotional comfort and encouragement. However, some
also find it challenging to cross the temporal boundary when there is a clash between
the time zones of their university location and their motherlands. Asian students
also tend to find that managing expectations from parents is an added burden when
adjusting to their university lives (Forbe-Mewett & Sawyer, 2016).



10.4.4 Study-Work-Family Demands on Married Couples
       and Parents

Many mature-age students pursue a university degree in order to expand their employ-
ment or career advancement opportunities. The investment of time, energy and
emotions in marital relationships and parenthood can take a toll on work-study-family
life balance for some couples and parents (Fincham & Ming, 2010), and a commit-
ment to further education can add to these work-life demands. Managing multiple
roles is a psychological burden for many university students who are also parents, and
they can feel guilty about being unavailable to their children while studying (Carney-
Crompton & Tan, 2002). Women, particularly, find it hard to maintain work-study-
family balance. These role strains can cause married women students intense stress,
anxiety and even depression (Darab, 2004). Some scholars have found that these
role conflicts impacting their academic achievement, and they eventually drop out
of study (Benshoff, 1991). Universities could help prevent this by providing special
counselling services for married students to help them develop coping strategies
and adjustment tools (Meehan & Negy, 2003), and university staff (educators) could
provide additional support by being sensitive and flexible, and adapting learning
programs to their unique needs.



10.4.5 Coping Strategies and Support

Universities around the globe have policies and measures in place to help both
domestic and international students cope with the challenges they face and balance
their work-study-life demands. For example, according to the Guide to best prac-
tice in international student mental health (2018), higher education institutions and
universities are required to:
• develop a safety plan to increase student awareness of mental health and minimise
  safety risks.
10.4 Work-Life Balance for Students                                                 237

• recognise vulnerable cohorts, such as under-eighteens and lesbian, gay, bisexual,
  transgender, queer, intersex and other diverse gender or sexuality identifying
  (LGBTQI+) students.
• develop and deliver targeted information in plain English (or the local language).
• provide training to enable staff to be sensitive to students’ needs.
• work with stakeholders, including community groups and local emergency
  services, to meet identified students’ needs.
• facilitate student reporting by allowing anonymous reporting or direct reporting
  to staff to protect students who need to complain or seek specific help.
• use data to review safety procedures.
• provide training and awareness for staff members who respond to students with
  mental health challenges.
• hold regular mental health promotion activities.
• develop procedures for early identification of mental health issues.
When one is aware of potential issues and prepared for them before stepping into
a commitment, such as enrolling at a university –whether local or overseas—it is
then easier to cope with the pressures it brings. Students need to be forewarned by
parents, friends and educators of what to expect (e.g., culture shock), how to manage
their time and priorities, what coping strategies to use to deal with homesickness and
loneliness, resiliency skills, and most important of all, how and where to seek help.
This will help them to plan for the endeavour of pursuing higher education.



10.5 Using EI to Strike a Work-Life Balance

Work-life balance is a critical aspect of a healthy work environment. As noted above, it
covers three major domains—physical, psychological and social wellbeing (Emmer-
ling & Boyatzis, 2012)—and affects the overall quality of an employee’s experi-
ence. Our emotions constitute strong psychological forces that influence our work
behaviour and performance, and there is now a plethora of literature and studies
providing evidence that individuals with higher EI will have better work-life balance
because they are better able to cope with stress and challenging situations and are
more adaptive to interpersonal and intrapersonal functioning (e.g., Elfenbein, 2007;
Kidwell et al., 2011; Kirk et al., 2008). Despite EI being a relatively new theory, it
has gained immense attention from business corporations and public organisations,
which recognise the role it plays in helping employees achieve work-life balance,
reduce stress and burnout, and maintain their physical and mental health.
238                                                        10 EI and Work-Life Balance

10.5.1 EI and Workplace Burnout

Garton (2017) reported that problems associated with employee burnout cost an
estimated $125 billion to $190 billion per year in corporate spending in the USA.
Increasingly, organisations around the world have realised that in order to be compet-
itive and efficient in today’s business environment, they need employees who are not
only competent in terms of their knowledge and technical skills, but have a high level
of EI (O’Boyle et al., 2011). Business owners and workplace leaders are becoming
more aware that EI plays a regulatory role between work attitudes and organisational
citizenship behaviour, and can therefore help to enhance job performance and limit
burnout (Pradhan et al., 2016). Maslach et al. (2001) explain that burnout includes
emotional exhaustion, loss of job satisfaction and lack of a sense of accomplish-
ment. When people are mentally and emotionally exhausted, it is harder for them
to maintain work-life balance. Durán et al. (2004) have provided empirical data
to show that individuals who are high in EI have both the ability to express their
emotions in alignment with their situation, and the ability to adjust their emotions in
order to contribute to goal achievement. Other scholars have also demonstrated that
employees with higher EI have higher levels of emotional control, are more able to
find solutions, and have the capability to apply emotional resources skilfully to gain
needed social support and avoid burnout (Brief & Weiss, 2002; Chan, 2006).



10.5.2 EI and Aspects of Work-Life Balance

In the literature, EI is strongly associated with work-life balance. Some of these
factors are mentioned in Sect. 10.2.1 above. In addition to these factors, the three
most studied factors with regards to EI and work-life balance are: job satisfaction,
job engagement and job stress.
Job satisfaction:    This is a feeling of fulfilment and gratification associated with
                     one’s job. It is associated with productivity and efficiency
                     in the workplace, as well as with the personal success of
                     individual’s. It reflects feelings of achievement and pride in
                     accomplishing a task or project, and can also contribute to
                     appreciation from others, personal growth and development,
                     productivity, advancement opportunities and increased income
                     (Kaliski, 2007). Individuals who demonstrate high EI are better
                     able to identify and control forces that drive the success or
                     failure of a task and have stronger communication skills and
                     decision-making capabilities, leading to success and greater
                     achievement (Stone et al., 1998). Workplace leaders who have
                     outstanding levels of EI are able to apply their social influ-
                     ence to motivate others and create enthusiasm for teamwork
10.5 Using EI to Strike a Work-Life Balance                                           239

                       to achieve goals and create a collective sense of achievement
                       (Chastukhina, 2012).
Job engagement:        This refers to the energy and enthusiasm that employees put
                       into their work to meet job demands, and the level of commit-
                       ment and involvement employees feel towards their workplace
                       (Stairs, 2005). Pritchard (2008) described employee engage-
                       ment as their level of commitment and loyalty to their work-
                       place, and Markos and Sridevi (2010) describe it as the harmo-
                       nious and positive relations between workers and leaders that
                       lead to emotional commitment to the workplace or organisation.
                       When employees are not satisfied with their work or workplace,
                       they have a tendency to become disengaged from their work and
                       work relationships with others. This negatively impacts staff
                       morale and can lead to absenteeism, increased turnover and
                       increased feelings of work-life imbalance.
People with high levels of EI are able to minimise work-related stress because they
have the ability to examine negative situations before making decisions and taking
action. They are generally clear on the requirements of their jobs, and are able to
handle conflict, maintain focus, listen to others and show empathy to support their
co-workers and colleagues (Washington & Shen, 2018).



10.5.3 EI and the Caring Industry

Professionals working in the caring industry (e.g., nurses, doctors, social workers,
welfare workers, psychologists and therapists, teachers, police officers, disability
carers, aged care workers and foster carers) experience high level of stress in their
daily work. Having to work with people who are hurt, sick, in a vulnerable condition,
or even violent is emotionally demanding. These professionals have to maintain
their own composure in distressing situations, correctly identify their own emotions
and those of others, and understand and manage those emotions (Baird & Kracen,
2006). Additionally, most of them have to work with limited resources, poor support
from their management hierarchy, and heavy workloads due to high staff turnover
(Benson & Magraith, 2005). EI thus plays a vital role in helping them to develop
their professional capabilities and proficiencies.
   Empathy is one of the key elements of EI, and a key requirement in the caring
industry. It is the ability to recognise, understand and appreciate how other people
feel, and to be able to articulate an understanding of different perspectives on a matter.
People with high levels of empathy can easily establish trust with others, and trust is
an important foundation for establishing interpersonal relationships. People high on
EI also tend to have a well-developed social conscience and a clear understanding of
their social responsibility and to act responsibly, displaying a social conscience and
willingness to collaborate with others to achieve goals. Professional care workers
240                                                         10 EI and Work-Life Balance

need a high level of EI to be able to hold tough conversations with the people they
serve and support. They need the capability to be assertive and to communicate
concerns effectively in order to create mutually respectful relationships in often
traumatically stressful situations. This, like empathy, is a skill that can be developed.
Chapter 12 of this book will provide more details on how to become more empathetic
and illustrate steps you can use to develop your empathy and build better relationships
in the caring industry.
    Organisations and small business owners in this industry can also help their staff
to reduce work pressure and find more balance in their lives. Shift work and staffing
patterns can impact the work-family-life balance, but when workers have the capa-
bility, knowledge and skills to develop their EI, they are better able to cope with
these challenges and manage the demands of their work and home lives. With a good
level of EI, workers, professionals, staff and leaders can all reduce stress, bounce
back more easily from challenges, plan and make time for their families, engage in
personal interests and hobbies, and pursue personal goals. They will be more able
to manage the spillover effect from work to home and stay focused on their work,
free from mental and emotional distractions. People with high levels of EI also know
where and how to seek help to overcome problems that burden their minds (Kaliski,
2007).



10.5.4 How Organisations Can Help Employees Find
       Work-Life Balance

The effects of work-related stress on our physical and mental health have been well
documented. Governments in advanced countries have put in place policies and
systems to help organisations and workplace leaders set up policies, procedures and
mechanisms to help their workers and employees attain a more balanced life.
   These strategies, noted by Baicker et al. (2010), Beauregard and Henry (2009)
and Dex and Scheibl (2001), include:
• providing training and development to increase EI in the workforce.
• helping workers and employees to better manage their workload using time and
  priority management skills.
• incorporating work-life balance policies into their organisations’ Occupational
  Health and Safety policies at work.
• providing more flexi-work programs and schedules to allow employees to match
  their work requirements with the timeslots that suit them.
• simplifying staff meeting arrangements and cutting down on the frequency of
  meetings to reduce time wastage.
• providing more recreation spaces, and opportunities and programs that encourage
  staff bonding and engagement in physical activities to reduce stress and anxiety.
• providing employee assistance programs to coach or counsel employees with
  family problems and work-related relationship problems.
10.5 Using EI to Strike a Work-Life Balance                                                      241

• providing on-site childcare facilities or subsidising payments to help working
  parents meet childcare demands.
• holding staff recognition and appreciation celebrations to encourage and acknowl-
  edge staff input and increase job satisfaction.
• building a positive workplace climate and a friendly and supportive organisational
  culture.
In the long run, encouraging work-life balance benefits everyone in the workforce
and contributes to a healthy workplace environment. When employees have more
time to spend with their families and have greater job satisfaction, they will be
more committed and loyal, and voluntarily put in the extra mile when required.
Meanwhile, employers will reap the rewards through improved productivity and
employee engagement, and decreased turnover.
    Life is a balancing act. Juggling competing demands and responsibilities is part of
it. With the increased societal demands, work demands, and personal life demands we
face, we need to develop an increased awareness of how these requirements impact
us and learn how to cope with them to attain balance in our lives. As illustrated in
this chapter, work-life balance can be attained at both the personal level and at the
organisational level. Having a higher level of EI means we will be better able to
understand ourselves and others, more objective when facing challenging situations,
and better able to control our emotions and responses to difficulties, so that we can
avoid stress and protect ourselves from mental health issues in the workplace.

Leadership and Emotional Intelligence




11.1 Introduction

Leaders with high levels of Emotional Intelligence (EI) are more likely to influ-
ence others in positive ways by supporting them with empathy and compassion,
building trusting relationships that lead to increased work performance, motiva-
tion and job satisfaction. This chapter therefore presents theoretical concepts and
research evidence to show how EI is important in leadership and how leaders can
develop effective EI skills for leadership. It also explores the dark side of leadership,
which manifests when leaders become negative and malicious, causing damage to
the organisation and harm to their co-workers. It covers factors that can lure a good
leader to the dark side, and ways that individuals can develop awareness of these
factors and avoid sliding into the dark territory of workplace immorality. Finally, it
introduces measures that organisations can take to deter dark leadership, and develop
collective EI.



11.2 What Is Leadership?

The construct of leadership has evolved markedly in the last century and a half,
and there is now a vibrant range of approaches, models and theories to help us
understand and explain what it encompasses. One of the most renowned authors
on this subject, Peter Northouse, teaches that ‘leadership is a process whereby an
individual influences a group in order to achieve a common goal’ (2010, p. 3).
   Drawing on his three decades of experience and expertise on the subject of lead-
ership, Northouse recently gave a comprehensive introduction to the major schools

of thought on leadership that have been studied across the globe over the past 150
years (Northouse, 2016). Here is a brief summary:

1800s to 1940s
Great Man Theory: In the mid-1800s, scholars of leadership believed that leaders
were not made but born. They were considered to be exceptional people gifted with
unique qualities and attributes, and destined to be leaders.
Trait Theory: Influenced by the Great Man Theory, scholars in the early to mid-
1900s believed that leadership traits could be developed, and valued intelligence,
masculinity and dominance as common leadership traits. However, some believed
that leadership varied from situation to situation, leading to the birth of situational
theory.
Situational Theory: This school of thoughts suggested that effective leaders were
those capable of using different leadership strategies and leadership styles to lead
and influence people to accomplish tasks and achieve goals. It had a strong link to
behavioural theory, especially in its focus on adaptability and flexibility.

1950s to 1970s
Behavioural Theory: In the 1950s, intellectuals began to focus on human behaviour
and skills as the source of leadership success. The two key factors determining leader-
ship effectiveness were considered to include competencies in people-oriented lead-
ership (the ability to support others at the personal level) and task-oriented leadership
(the ability to establish structure to get things done).
Contingency Theory: In the mid-1960s, interest in leadership studies shifted to a
focus on both behaviour and skills. Contingency theory argued that leaders should
adopt different leadership styles to manage different people in different situations.
This theory also considered the leader’s position of power, the degree of task structure
and the leader-staff member relationship.

1970s to 1990s
Leader-Member Exchange Theory: From the 1970s to the 1990s, interest shifted to
studying the intermix of leader characteristics, follower characteristics, interpersonal
relationships, contextual variables and how these affected outcomes in achieving
organisational goals, relational goals and organisational effectiveness.
Transactional Leadership: Transactional leaders were considered to concentrate on
results and conform to a system of rewards and penalties. They viewed themselves
as figures of a responsible authority, driven by routines to manage individual and
organisational performance. This style of leadership was widely practised after World
War II, when the focus was on rebuilding with a high level of structure to maintain
national stability. Today, transactional leadership is still valued among some leaders
who focus on short-term goals, favour structured procedures and protocols, and thrive
on observing rules and doing things ‘right’.
11.2 What is Leadership?                                                              251

Transformational leadership: In contrast to Transactional Leadership, advocates
for Transformational Leadership believed that effective leaders should inspire and
motivate their staff by understanding their needs and supporting them without micro-
managing, by building trust and inspiring them to transform (grow and develop) to
meet the changing demands on the workforce.

The new millennium
Distributed leadership: As the world becomes more complex and dynamic, some are
now arguing that leadership must be shared. Scholars in leadership studies have begun
to write about the significance of distributed leadership, teamwork and collaboration.
This is especially applicable when organisations become global, with international
branches and multinational work teams.
Authentic leadership: In the 2000s, following the global economic downturn caused
by the greed of big business and corrupt practices in many financial and governmental
organisations, the literature has advocated for a strong focus on honesty and integrity
in leadership. The Authentic Leadership model calls for leaders to be genuine and
transparent. Other authentic qualities include being mindful and self-aware, having
the ability to understand their own and others’ thoughts, feelings, motives and values,
having the capability to build honest and supportive relationships, and having the
ability to resolve conflict and the integrity to observe social and ethical values.
Entrepreneurial leadership: The focus of leadership studies has also shifted from
large corporations and organisations to small-to-medium businesses. Entrepreneurial
leadership is the capability to turn problems into opportunities to create economic
and social values. It involves strong self-belief, creative and innovative thinking, risk-
taking, problem-solving and strong people and networking skills. This leadership
concept is important for both large corporations and organisations and small-to-
medium businesses, which make up 60-90% of the world’s economic contributions.
Neuro-based leadership: This school of thought integrates the ideologies and
insights of positive psychology, social neuroscience, leadership practice and organ-
isational studies to propose a new kind of brain-based leadership—the capa-
bility to optimise workers’ engagement, performance, job satisfaction, productivity,
innovation and to achieve planned goals.

The evolution of leadership theories and approaches demonstrates that we have
moved on from valuing authority, compliance, correction, rigid policies and a reward-
punishment mindset of the past, to a more human-focused, supportive, cooperative
and collaborative mentality that values the nurturing of growth and development. It
also shows a shift in focus, to respect for staff and employees, acceptance of different
perspectives, and facilitation of innovation. Through this futuristic lens, leadership is
associated with the removal of boundaries, the encouragement of bold exploration,
the power of networking, and the use of technology to advance new knowledge with
which we can greet and shape our future.
   However, the concept of leadership does not only apply to people with positional
power. Charan et al. (2001) argue that everyone is a leader. We begin our leadership
252                                             11 Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

journeys by being individual contributors in our workplaces or organisations. Self-
leadership requires the capability of self-awareness: knowing who we are, setting
our personal goals, developing interpersonal, social and communication skills, and
managing our time and priorities to maintain a healthy work-life balance. From self-
leadership, we move on to leading followers; these can include student groups in
high schools or college, community groups, or teams in the workplace.
    To advance to further leadership roles, we need to demonstrate our proficiency
in technical or professional skills, but we also need to focus on developing our
people management skills. This is a transitional challenge for many who excel as
first-level leaders in roles such as a team supervisor, but struggle when they have to
find a balance between leading projects, programs and plans and leading different
groups of people, for example by managing up and down and in a multidirectional
way. As we progress to more senior levels, another shift in focus must take place.
Senior leaders achieve through others; they must let go of hands-on work and lead
by providing vision, structure and support to empower others to do that work, to
lead and to gain success. The best part of being a leader is being able to understand
people, communicate with them clearly and effectively, and help and influence them
so that they can progress and achieve life satisfaction or professional success.



11.3 EI and Leadership

EI, as previously mentioned, is the individual’s capacity to understand and manage
emotions. Initially, psychologists believed that EI is innate. However, thanks to over
three decades of research, specialists in the field now have a different view. For
example, Mayer et al. (2004) believe that EI is an ability that everyone can learn; Bar-
on (2004) describes it as an individual’s emotional, behavioural and social compe-
tence; and Daniel Goleman (1998) teaches that it is more important than IQ (cognitive
intelligence) and is a capability that can be learned to enhance personal relationships
and workplace performance.



11.3.1 Models of EI

Mayer, Salovey and Caruso began studying EI in the 1980s and subsequently devel-
oped an ability model which describes it as ‘the capacity to accurately perceive
emotions, and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to
promote emotional and intellectual growth’ (Mayer et al., 2004, p. 198). Their model
of EI ability comprises four elements: perceiving emotions, using emotions, under-
standing emotions and managing emotions. Additionally, they have developed a
measurement tool known as the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test
(MSCEIT), which is currently widely used globally to measure these four elements
of EI.
11.3 EI and Leadership                                                            253

   Bar-On (2004, 2006) also developed a model of EI, viewing it as a competency
comprising five domains: self-perception (including self-regard, self-actualisation
and emotional self-awareness); interpersonal competence (including interpersonal
relationships, empathy and social responsibility); decision-making competence
(including problem-solving, reality testing and impulse control); self-expression
competence (including emotional expression, assertiveness and independence); and
stress management (including stress tolerance, flexibility and optimism). To measure
such competencies, Bar-on has developed two measurement tools to measure an
individual’s emotional quotient (EQ). They are the EQ-I 2.0 and EQ 360 Composite
Scales and Subscales. He has also developed a tool to help to measure the EQ of
children. This scale, known as The Bar-On EQ-i:YV, is widely used in education,
especially in the UK, Europe and Asia.
   Daniel Goleman ignited global interests in the concept of EI with his book
Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ (1995). In this book,
he described four basic components of EI: self-awareness, other-awareness, self-
management and relationship management. After another decade of exploring and
researching EI, Goleman, his colleague Boyatzis and researchers from HayGroup in
Boston developed an EI performance model and the Emotional and Social Compe-
tency Inventory (ESCI), which measures twelve competencies covering four domains
(HayGroup, 2011). These domains are:
• Domain 1: Emotional Self-awareness: This involves recognising and under-
  standing our own emotions.
• Domain 2: Social awareness: This involves recognising and understanding the
  emotions of others, empathy and organisational awareness,
• Domain 3: Self-management: This involves effectively managing our own
  emotions, and includes emotional self-control, achievement orientation, positive
  outlook and adaptability.
• Domain 4: Relationship management: This involves applying our emotional
  understanding in our dealings with others, and includes the ability to influ-
  ence, coach and mentor, manage conflict and provide inspirational leadership
  and teamwork.


11.3.2 Why Is EI Important in Leadership?

Inspiring evidence has been captured in the contemporary literature showing that EI
plays an important role in leadership. Siegling et al. (2014) established that leaders
who scored high in trait EI assessments showed more leadership potential and strong
self-efficacy in their leadership roles. Leaders with high EI are more able to build
trust and work with integrity and honesty, and to demonstrate their ability to walk
the talk. They are able to build strong, cohesive teams, motivate and inspire, consult
and make collaborative decisions, and empower staff to take initiative and become
more creative (Higgs & Aitken, 2003; Palmer et al., 2001).
254                                             11 Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

    Research reports have also substantiated a strong correlation between leaders
with high EI and organisational effectiveness. These studies found that EI positively
influenced the promotion of teamwork, increased employee commitment, morale and
health, elevated productivity, work efficiency and innovation, and improved quality
of service and customer loyalty (Batool, 2013; Côté et al., 2010).
    Studies have shown how emotionally competent leaders can influence members
of a workplace or organisation by facilitating a climate that promotes individual
and group productivity and performance, building support structures, encouraging
warmth and support among the workers and employees, showing appreciation and
valuing staff input, setting clear guidelines on roles and responsibilities, and encour-
aging tolerance of diversity and difference. Leaders with strong EI can generate
attitudinal change and lead a reflective culture, and encourage adaptability, initiative
and creativity (Abdulkarim, 2013; Ashkanasy & Nicholson, 2003; Chan, 2014).
    Team leaders who are competent in self-awareness and other-awareness are able
to build consensus in teams, manage diversity and drive overall team effectiveness.
They are able to strategise goal achievement by tapping into the emotional and
behavioural capabilities of the team, utilise different talents and provide the needed
‘glue’ to increase team bonding and unity. They know how to effectively delegate,
reward performance, coach members who need extra support and establish high
standards to get optimum results (Goleman, 2014; Harminder & Jaya, 2011; Stough
et al., 2009).



11.4 Leading with EI

Based on their years of studying and working with global leaders, Goleman et al.
(2002) have identified six leadership styles that leaders with high EI demonstrate:
visionary leadership, commanding leadership, democratic leadership, coaching lead-
ership, pace-setting leadership and affiliative leadership. They affirm that strong
leaders are able to deploy these six styles and switch between them to suit different
situations and different people. To become leaders with high levels of EI, we can
work to develop the core competencies underlying these six leadership qualities.



11.4.1 Visionary Leadership

Effective and forward-looking leaders are visionary thinkers who are able to stimulate
others to create an ideal future through their ability to create and communicate a
coherent vision of the organisation’s purpose and direction. They are perceptive and
confident in embracing the unknown, and see problems and understand issues before
others do. They have the ability to come up with fresh perspectives and breakthrough
ideas, introduce new paradigms that create value in their business/service. A visionary
leader is skilled in turning visions into reality by stating clear goals and developing
11.4 Leading with EI                                                                255

strategic plan and support structures to achieve those goals. They can inspire their
followers to boldly strive for and achieve new heights in organisational success.
   Individuals with innovative talents and creative thinking ability can develop this
leadership capability more easily than others. However, we can all develop our
visionary thinking and leadership skills by:
• constantly challenging ourselves to learn more at a faster rate, especially additional
  skills in problem analysis and process improvement.
• learning to anticipate problems by identifying the paradigms that govern our
  beliefs, assumptions and expectations, and learning how to think in different
  paradigms (for example, by reading more widely and engaging in relevant
  discussions).
• expanding our awareness and seeking out new information related to our
  industries, professions or businesses.
• learning and practising lateral thinking and synergistic approaches in order to
  develop creative ideas.
• understanding the role of a visionary leader and developing skills to communicate
  our mission to others and it.
• looking for signals and opportunities in the market, and paying attention to what
  our business associates or opponents are doing.
• identifying risks in our business or profession, and areas that require attention and
  improvement, amendments or progress.
• maintaining a long-term, big-picture view of the business/service and identifying
  current imperfections and future needs, as well as how the organisation must adapt
  to meet these needs.
• staying abreast of important international trends and global activities that could
  impact our business/profession.
• having a clear understanding of our organisation’s mission and business processes,
  and ensuring that policies and plans align with the organisation’s purpose and
  growth.
• most important of all, having wide-ranging curiosity and interests.


11.4.2 Commanding Leadership

Commanding leadership is also known as directive leadership. We employ this lead-
ership style when we need to assign clear accountability, clarify employees’ roles
and responsibilities, take preventive measures to avoid a crisis, tackle problems that
need to be resolved urgently, intervene to address lagging performance and barriers
to achievement, confront problem performers and integrate efforts across functions
and organisation.
   A commanding leader is one who is highly experienced and skilled with projects
and tasks, understands competency requirements and knows how to monitor results
256                                             11 Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

and outcomes. They understand what is required for successful completion of a
project or a plan, and are knowledgeable in assigning tasks to team members based
on their talents and skill in order to reach productivity and task fulfilment. They
can adequately communicate expectations without seeming arrogant or bossy. An
emotionally intelligent commanding leader is able to delegate effectively to give staff
a sense of empowerment, and support those who need additional development.
    The word ‘commanding’ does not mean nasty, tough or micromanaging. Leading
with EI means having the ability to be forceful and direct, and to confront prob-
lems by understanding staff members’ their needs and perspectives, identifying their
skill deficiencies, managing disagreements about rules and policies and determining
the importance of discrepancies, and helping staff members to grow. Commanding
leaders are able to carry out corrective action by making people aware of the situation
and involving them in being part of the solution.
    To become an emotionally intelligent commanding or directive leader, we need
to learn to:
• understand change and change management and have a clear idea of personal and
  organisational processes.
• analyse the barriers to success that cause attention and concern.
• provide clarity on rules and expectations, and support for new and inexperienced
  members of the team.
• help people to learn and accept that continual change and improvement are
  required in our work life.
• encourage staff to work out problems and come up with solutions.
• provide support structures to assist staff members who need to strengthen their
  skill set and address performance gaps.
• make collaboration an expectation and set up support structures to enhance
  teamwork and build a collaborative climate.



11.4.3 Democratic Leadership

A democratic leader works both through and with others. Democratic leadership is
also known as participatory leadership, distributed leadership and integrative lead-
ership. An emotionally intelligent democratic leader can attract and select the best
high-calibre talents and build strong teams with members who have complementary
strengths. They encourage and value diversity in the organisation’s talent pool, and
are able to recognise and unleash the full potential of others by providing needed
resources, support, coaching and structure. They can create an environment that
provides direction and promotes continuous learning and development, and develop
successors and talents by knowing and accurately appraising the strengths and needed
strength of their direct reports.
   Leaders who combine EI and democratic leadership skills are able to promote
ideas persuasively because they have the ability to identify, build or create areas of
11.4 Leading with EI                                                               257

common ground with others. They are highly aware of their stakeholders’ needs,
and realise that every situation is unique and every group has a different dynamic.
They have a range of influencing skills and are able to positively assert their ideas
and motivate and energise others by connecting with them in the emotional sphere.
They are very approachable and convey confidence in their team. When delegating,
they have the techniques necessary to set the context and then let go. By taking on
a participatory leadership role, democratic leaders can help their staff realistically
evaluate the outcomes of team decisions and effort, and decide which team processes
work best and which ones need improvement.
   To become competent democratic leaders, we need to learn how to:
• nurture and develop staff by giving them the opportunity and latitude to trial their
  initiatives.
• create a climate that energises, excites and stretches staff members, and promote
  personal investment in their careers and professional growth.
• promote collaboration and remove obstacles to team unity.
• understand the art of empowerment by finding out what makes our staff members
  feel empowered, and unchallenged.
• communicate high expectations and challenging goals, and inspire people to excel
  by demonstrating excellence as a role model.
• create an active performance review process that reinforces distinguished perfor-
  mance and provides constructive feedback and coaching to consolidate new
  knowledge and skills.
• promote an atmosphere of respect and an environment that is friendly and
  supportive.
• develop a culture that values diversity, and deal with inappropriate comments and
  behaviour effectively.
• develop the capability to work through conflicts and create win/win outcomes,
  and to negotiate skilfully to achieve mutually beneficial goals.



11.4.4 Coaching Leadership

Coaching leadership is practised by caring leaders who help their staff members to
grow and develop, and improve their performance, work behaviour and attitudes.
Similar to democratic leadership, it is characterised by support, guidance and collab-
oration. Empathy is a significant component of coaching leadership, because it is
not about what the leader wants to coach but what the staff member needs to learn
and what skills they need to develop. Coaching benefits both the coaching leader
and the coachees by fostering quality in their efforts to achieve their personal and
organisational goals.
   Coaching is a process that aims to unlock someone’s potential and maximise their
performance. Instead of giving instructions and directives, a staff member builds self-
belief and self-confidence via learning goals that they set for themselves. A skilled
258                                             11 Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

coach can lead a coachee to recognise blind spots by increasing their self-awareness,
identify their learning needs, build on their strengths and think about different ways
to improve themselves. This approach removes blame and relieves the fear of making
mistakes, and thus has a more direct impact on the employee’s desire to grow and
make improvement.
    One of the biggest challenges when coaching is being able to ask powerful ques-
tions that foster deep thinking. It is so much easier to tell someone what to do, or
give instructions or directives to a staff member. However, through self-discovery and
having a conversation with a supervisor or colleague who cares, a staff member can
develop the drive and motivation to plan and achieve goals for change and improve-
ment. Effective coaches make a conscious effort to develop a range of communication
styles and skills so that they can switch their communication techniques for different
coachees to meet different needs. To develop our coaching leadership, we need to:
• develop active listening skills so we can listen attentively to help coachees explore
  issues in greater breadth and depth.
• learn to ask power questions to identify not only facts but underlying issues.
• learn to use appropriate terminology and to reframe questions and ideas when
  necessary to demonstrate care and sensitivity.
• know how to tap into coachees’ personal values to motivate them to plan goals
  for self-enhancement.
• develop effective goal-setting techniques so that goals are achievable, actionable
  and measurable, with sub-goals if necessary.
• elicit ideas by engaging in collaborative brainstorming or providing coachees with
  case studies, examples and alternatives that they can choose from.
• convey con confidence in coachees’ ability and desire to do their best.
• be empathetic and put ourselves in our coachees’ shoes to draw out problems and
  the roots of conflict or challenges.
• encourage reflection by asking insightful, open-ended questions that prompt
  coachees to think through situations from many different angles.
• be resourceful, and instead of telling coachees what to do, provide resources so
  that they can make an effort to take the needed action to effect change or growth
  independently.
Coaching leaders are more than supervisors or advisers. They are trusted supporters,
or even friends, who are committed to helping their staff and are respected and
regarded as trustworthy, helpful and reliable.



11.4.5 Pace-Setting Leadership

Pace-setting leadership requires a leader to set an example of high performance,
appropriate work pace and quality of work. This leadership style is suitable for
working with highly motivated and competent staff members who need very little
direction (e.g., professionals such as teachers, engineers, scientists, lawyers and
11.4 Leading with EI                                                                259

doctors). This leadership style works better when the leader and the team have a
high degree of trust and a mutually supportive relationship. Regrettably, this style of
leadership does not tend to work with employees who are highly dependent on their
leaders to provide them with constant feedback and guidance. Nor will it work with
employees who are not strong on big-picture thinking.
    A pace-setting leadership style is appropriate when a team is behind due to barriers
that have not been identified, or changes in the internal or external environment that
have caused a down spell. An emotionally intelligent pace-setting leader will be able
to work out what the obstacles and hurdles are, outline key steps that the team needs to
undertake to make necessary changes, and provide a timeline to ensure completion
with expected outcomes. This will work when the team is a high performing one
comprising self-driven, high-calibre staff.
    Pace-setting leadership is best used when there is pressure to deliver results or
complete a project within a specified timeline. It can also be used when the leader
notices faltering morale and wants to lift performance standards and boost optimism
and team spirit. The advantage of using a pace-setting leadership style is it helps that
to get things done quickly, efficiently and to a high standard. However, if it is used
inappropriately, employees can become overwhelmed and stressed because of the
demands on them. To learn how to use a pace-setting leadership style effectively, it
is important to:
• communicate in terms of strategic priorities and goals, and use communication
  as a learning opportunity for the staff.
• focus attention on core content (e.g., what is the desired outcome or timeline) and
  present our goals with a logical and chronological, simple-to-complex structure.
• convey a commitment to understanding and doing what is required, and commu-
  nicate why it is important to put project success above individual gain.
• develop (or boost) team confidence by emotionally connecting with team members
  and gaining their respect, trust and loyalty.
• manage anxiety by engaging the team in a mental scanning of the psychological
  impact of the project being undertaken (e.g., its time and work demands), and
  discuss how they can manage anxiety or stress and how they need to be supported.
• work constructively and calmly under stress and pressure.
• cope effectively with political realities.
• understand the overall strategies of the organisation and know the drivers of the
  teams we lead.
• put in place some measures to support staff when required, and ensure that staff
  members know that they are not completely on their own.
• put in place contingency plans in case something unexpected happens.
• maintain a constructive, positive outlook even if plans are thwarted.

11.4.6 Affiliative Leadership

Affiliative leaders bring a strong sense of belonging to the work culture. They connect
with people at all levels of the organisation, and relate well with their peers and
colleagues, direct reports and higher management. They respect individual difference
and recognise and respond to the needs and concerns of their staff members. They
promote collaboration and continuously seek to improve how management and team
members can work together to achieve individual and organisational goals.
    The affiliative leadership style works best in times of challenge, such as cutbacks
or drops in productivity or profits due to internal or external environmental factors,
when staff members need to understand what is going on, process any sense of
insecurity and work through their emotions with a leader they can trust. A caring
affiliative leader can support workers and employees to reduce workplace stress,
increase workplace wellbeing and encourage positive workplace interactions. Affil-
iative leaders understand the organisation’s human capital strategies and how staff
members are supported. They take care of the learning and development needs of
staff members and also support organisational growth by providing necessary training
and development to encourage growth and increased competencies and performance
qualities.
    To develop an affiliative leadership style, we need to:
• identify current networks and find opportunities to develop new relationships or
  strengthen existing ones.
• connect with people through face-to-face communication, rather than merely via
  email or digital means.
• be mindful of our communication style, choice of words and language, non-verbal
  cues and tone of voice.
• develop and practise effective interpersonal communication, including giving
  non-verbal attention to people when talking with them, and using traditional
  communication etiquette such as saying, ‘Thank you’ and ‘please’.
• be active listeners, show patience and adjust to others’ communication styles.
• create an environment of acceptance and confront disrespectful and discriminatory
  behaviours and practices.
• promote teamwork and collaboration across the organisation.
• build trust by maintaining high standards of personal integrity.
• emphasise integrity and concern for people, and articulate the underlying values
  and principles that guide your leadership and treatment of others: no one can be
  a perfect role model, but people will notice and respect a sincere effort.



11.5 The Dark Side of Leadership

While there are volumes of literature on organisational studies and leadership focused
on effective leadership and the positive qualities of successful leaders, interest in the
11.5 The Dark Side of Leadership                                                     261

‘dark side’ of leadership has also increased in the last two decades. The term ‘the
dark side of leadership’ refers to the practices of abusive and self-serving leaders
whose destructive and toxic behaviours create a range of negative consequences
for workplaces and organisations, including increased absenteeism, high turnover,
occupational stress and mental health issues among staff members.



11.5.1 What Is Dark Leadership?

Dark leadership describes leaders who engage in destructive behaviours and act to
serve their self-interest at the expense of the organisation’s welfare and produc-
tivity (Benson & Campbell, 2007; Krasikova et al., 2013). Some scholars think that
not all ‘dark leaders’ are entirely evil or destructive; some only behave in toxic
and destructive ways when they are stressed or under pressure to produce results
(Kaiser & Hogan, 2007). Many leaders, especially charismatic ones, are able to
lead based on their personalised power to effect change and produce results with
their admiring followers and fans. However, when these leaders fall prey to greed
for money and/or power, they can develop an insatiable need for recognition and
control, and unintentionally get pulled to the ‘dark side’.
    There are three major themes prevalent in the literature that describes dark
leadership. They are abusive supervision, leadership derailment and toxic leadership.
   Abusive supervision: This is a dysfunctional type of leadership observed in
   leaders in supervisory roles who generally engage in disrespectful and offen-
   sive behaviours when interacting with staff members. These behaviours include
   yelling, ridicule, belittling, rudeness, invasions of privacy and using the silent
   treatment as a demonstration of power. Studies on abusive supervisors have found
   that these individuals usually target staff members who appear to be vulnerable,
   quiet and unwilling or unable to defend themselves. They also found that abusive
   supervisors are low on thoughtfulness, angry in general, easily frustrated and
   usually impulsive (Martinko et al., 2013; Tepper, 2007).
   Leadership derailment: This is defined as either career derailment or an overuse
   of strengths. Leader career derailment is thought to be the result of a combina-
   tion of two factors: an inability to adapt or develop (i.e., to learn from mistakes
   and feedback), and a lack of the personality traits needed to build effective
   working relationships. Derailment occurs when leaders only capitalise on their
   key strengths and fail to develop more widely, so that they ultimately fail to deliver
   when confronted by circumstances that require a broader range of capabilities.
   These leaders tend to be rigid and low on both self-awareness and other-awareness,
   and are poor at establishing essential work relationships with others. Many of
   them display insensitive, abrasive and bullying behaviours, appear to be aloof,
   arrogant and emotionally volatile, and fail to listen to or accept alternative views
   and perspectives (Benson & Campbell, 2007; Judge & Lepine, 2007, Najar et al.,
   2004).
262                                              11 Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

     Toxic leadership: This describes a negative pattern of behaviour shown by leaders
     who focus on self-serving intents and sabotage or undermine the achievements of
     other staff members and colleagues. Krasikova et al. (2013) have shown that toxic
     leadership does not necessarily equate to ineffective or incompetent leadership,
     and claim that toxic leaders act with intent to be destructive in order to gain
     power or control. Padilla et al. (2007) describe toxic leaders as having a selfish
     orientation, focusing effort and resources only on serving their self-interest and
     gains rather than on the common good. They added that toxic leaders employ
     dominance, coercion and manipulation rather than influence, commitment and
     persuasion to achieve goals, and their behaviour compromises the quality of work
     life in an organisation.
Padilla et al. (2007) have noted five characteristics associated with destructive leaders:
personalised power, charisma, narcissism, negative life themes and an ideology of
hate. Likewise, Burke (2006) outlined his observations of individuals considered to
be dark leaders. He claimed that these leaders are generally incompetent and lack the
will or skill to create effective action or positive change. They are usually callous,
uncaring, unkind and insensitive to the needs of others. Many are also impulsive and
lack self-control. Some have negative personal characteristics and are more likely to
lie, cheat, steal and engage in corrupt activities. They are narrow-minded and insular.
and ignore the needs and welfare of others. Some may even intentionally cause harm
to others.



11.5.2 Factors Steering Leaders to the Dark Side

Leaders are not drawn to the dark side overnight, and they are not solely to blame for
becoming toxic and destructive. The work environment and the influence of followers
can also contribute to the making of the work antihero. Many of these followers, who
can be called ‘colluders’, share the same values and motivations as the toxic leader
and consciously engage in morally dubious behaviour with their toxic boss, engaging
in unethical acts because there is a direct benefit for them in doing so (Padilla et al.,
2007). There are also followers who conform and serve the toxic leader because they
are afraid of negative consequences if they fail to do so; many of these ‘conformers’
have low self-esteem, low EI and psychological maturity, poor judgement, and unmet
needs that they think their leader can fulfil. And others susceptible followers choose
to conform because of the group apathy effect (everyone is doing it) or the belief that
subordinates should be obedient to their superior (May et al., 2014; Padilla et al.,
2007).
   From her studies of the followers of dark leaders, Lipman-Blumen (2005)
identifies three types of followers who enable and support toxic leaders. They are:
1.    Benign followers, who are gullible and do not question the negative actions of
      their leaders, or prefer to conform for practical reasons such as keeping their
      jobs.
11.5 The Dark Side of Leadership                                                      263

2.   The leader’s entourage, who are committed to and willing to collude with the
     leader and their team members to gain control or power and to serve the leader’s
     agenda.
3.   Malevolent followers, who are driven by greed and competitiveness but aim to
     overthrow the leader once they are able to overpower him or her.
The influence of these followers is instrumental because it accentuates the leader’s
shortcomings and strengthens their desire to achieve goals and gain power by hook
or by crook.
   The environmental factors that can nurture and sustain the development of dark
leadership include questionable cultural values (e.g., workplaces where bullying and
discrimination are not banned), workplace insecurity (e.g., when leaders centralise
their control by making fundamental changes), perceived threat (e.g., when the organ-
isation is dependent on a ‘star’ who is also a toxic leader to get them through a crisis
or business survival threat), and an extreme laissez-faire governance style with no set
standards and no checks and boundaries on leadership competence and effectiveness
(Milosevic et al., 2020; Padilla et al., 2007).



11.5.3 Types of Dark Leadership

Psychologists have identified the three most malevolent qualities of the dark leader
and categorised them as the ‘dark triad’. They are narcissism, Machiavellianism and
psychopathy.
   Narcissism is characterised by egotism, pride, grandiosity and a lack of empathy.
Narcissists have inflated views of themselves and their abilities, feel entitled to exces-
sive rewards and recognition, and seek power, influence and control (Ackerman et al.,
2011).
   Machiavellianism is characterised by an absence of morality, the manipulation
and exploitation of others, a high level of self-interest, and very low EI. Machiavels
tend to be very cold to others and use ingratiation and intimidation to get what they
want. Many of them demonstrate a love of money and prestige, and will behave in
unethical ways to get them (Boddy et al., 2015; Dahling et al., 2009).
   Psychopathy is characterised by impulsivity, selfishness, unemotional traits,
continuous antisocial behaviour and an absence of remorse. Psychopaths are intol-
erant and easily bored. Some exhibit parasitic behaviour and behave in irresponsible
and deceitful ways. Many use bullying and intimidation to create a culture of fear
(Boddy et al., 2015).
   Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that all of these three traits share
key characteristics such as lack of empathy, interpersonal hostility and interpersonal
offensiveness (Campbell et al., 2011; Jones & Paulhus, 2011).

11.5.4 A Trait Approach to Understanding Dark Leadership

Psychologists believe that there are five basic dimensions of personality traits, which
they have termed the ‘Big Five’. The Big Five help to identify both positive and nega-
tive leadership traits. They are openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeable-
ness and neuroticism. Every dimension of these traits has both positive and negative
impacts on an individual, and for decades, psychologists have made use of these
traits to understand leaders and leadership.
• Openness: People who are high in openness tend to be curious and eager to
  learn new things. They also have a broad range of interests and enjoy challenges.
  They are generally creative and have the ability to think about abstract concepts. In
  contrast, people who are low on this trait dislike change and resist new ideas. They
  are not very imaginative and are not likely to understand theoretical concepts.
• Conscientiousness: People who are high in conscientiousness are thoughtful and
  have good impulse control. They are very responsible and tend to be organised.
  They plan ahead and complete tasks in a timely manner, paying attention to detail.
  They care about what others think of them and are careful not to make mistakes.
  They usually have a timeframe and a set schedule to work with. In contrast, those
  who are low on conscientiousness dislike structure and schedules, tends to be
  messy or careless with their work, and may have a tendency to procrastinate or
  not complete their assigned tasks. They may also show irresponsible behaviours
  such as not returning things they have borrowed or putting things back where they
  belong.
• Extroversion: People with a high extraversion trait are described as being
  excitable, socially active, talkative and usually emotionally expressive. They are
  outgoing and enjoy being the centre of attention. They can easily build rapport
  with anyone and find it easy to make new friends. They also feel energised around
  people and tend to have a large circle of friends. In contrast, those who are low
  on extraversion prefer solitude, are generally quiet and dislike making small talk.
  They feel more comfortable pondering their inner thoughts and ideas rather than
  focusing on what’s happening externally, and enjoy spending time with just one
  or two people, rather than in large groups or crowds.
• Agreeableness: People who are high in agreeableness are generally kind, altruistic
  and cooperative, and show prosocial behaviour. They show interest in other people
  and care about them. They tend to be high in EI and easily feel empathy towards
  people. They enjoy helping others and do things to make people happy. In contrast,
  those who are low in agreeableness tend to show little interest in others, and can
  be selfish, manipulative to get what they want and argumentative, and may even
  insult and belittle others.
• Neuroticism: People with this trait are generally characterised by moodiness,
  constant sadness and emotional instability. They can be irritable and get upset
  easily. They worry excessively over small matters, experience a lot of self-
  generated stress, and struggle to bounce back. In contrast, those who are low in
11.5 The Dark Side of Leadership                                                      265

   neurotic traits are emotionally stable, rarely feel sad or depressed, are generally
   calm and relaxed, and are naturally resilient.
The trait theory indicates that personality traits have both positive and negative
components. When leaders are aware of the characteristics attached to these traits,
they can harness their strengths to become effective leaders. Personality tests are
useful tools that can help us identify our strengths, motivations and attitudes, and
enable us to find out where our talents are best served. Personality tests that use a
trait approach can also help us shine a light on our ‘dark sides’ and increase our self-
awareness so that we can refrain from drawing on our negative traits and behaviour
when we are under stress, or being influenced by others to cross the border into the
dark side.



11.5.5 How Leadership Strengths Can Turn Malicious

Scholars of organisational leadership believe that leaders are most likely to cross
to the dark side and engage in dysfunctional behaviours when they have an exces-
sive need to achieve, to compete or to feed their egos. Some believe that having a
moderate level of dark-side tendencies can actually be helpful to leadership success,
and even view these tendencies as ‘situational strengths’ (Furnham et al., 2012).
However, when these characteristics become too extreme, or when certain behaviours
are overused, they can create problems. Many leaders engage in ‘derailing behaviour’
when their personal and psychological resources are depleted. This is especially true
for those who rely on specific leadership styles and do not know how to switch their
leadership strategies to suit different groups of followers. Leaders who are low on
self-awareness and other-awareness are less likely to realise that they need contin-
uous learning and development to increase their leadership capability and reduce
their negative impact on others and in the workplace. (Benson & Campbell, 2007;
Hogan & Hogan, 2001).
    Hogan and Hogan (2001) developed a measurement tool to help leaders under-
stand their potential leadership challenges as indicated by their personality traits.
This tool, known as the Hogan Development Survey (HDS scale), gives insight
into how some personality strengths can become weaknesses and cause leadership
derailment (i.e., failure to fulfil role expectations). It measures 11 personality charac-
teristics to help individuals develop self-awareness and recognise how these charac-
teristics can affect their thoughts and behaviour when they are under stress, leading
them to act with ‘dark demeanour’ (Hogan Assessments, 2015). The results of the
assessment are explained by trained consultants who produce a detailed report to
help leaders to recognise their shortcomings, maximise their strengths and develop
leadership-enhancing skills.
    Dark leadership literature points out that some leaders transform into dark leaders
due to a lack of self-awareness, especially of their emotionally charged. They may
have painful past experiences that drive them, and/or pick up negative cues from
266                                             11 Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

the workplace that lead them to behave in ‘dark’ ways. Leaders must therefore be
aware of any tendencies they have to engage in behaviours that negatively impact
others in the workplace, and develop self-awareness and self-regulation strategies
to enable them to curtail their damaging impact on others. Leaders who have the
capability to engage in intrapersonal self-regulatory processes will be able to control
their impulsivity, curb their crave for power and control and achieve their goals in
more positive ways (Vazire & Funder, 2006).
    Self-regulation processes incorporate personal characteristics (including an
understanding of one’s own trait behaviours and self-esteem), skills (self-
observation, self-monitoring and self-talk) and self-discipline and emotional self-
control (knowing what to stop doing and what to do more). They also require a
person to be willing to change. But it is not possible to do all these alone. Leaders
who have fallen to the dark side will therefore need help from different sources. Some
of the more effective of these include behavioural coaching to increase self-awareness
and identify motives and triggers, personality and trait-behaviour assessments and
multi-rater assessments such as 360-degree profiling to help leaders identify their
self-image, how others view them, and how they impact others in the workplace.
(Moran, 2011; Trickey & Hyde, 2009; van Knippenberg, 2012).



11.6 How to Prevent Leaders from Being Drawn
     to the Dark Side

Most dark leaders are not aware of their behaviour. A snake does not know it is
poisonous, after all: it bites to protect itself, or to catch prey for its supper, which
is an act of survival. Part of the role of human capital specialists (also known as
human resources consultants or HR personnel, some of whom are trained profes-
sionals with degrees in organisational or industry psychology) is to help organisa-
tions identify problematic behaviour that negatively impacts the workplace, causing
a negative workplace climate and toxic culture. To prevent leaders slipping into a
dark space, HR personnel and management need to put in place preventive measures,
including ongoing leadership and managerial learning and development programs,
multi-source feedback, executive coaching, formal and informal mentoring and
action-learning groups.



11.6.1 Self-Directed Learning to Boost EI

There are some individuals who appear to be gifted with natural leadership skills and
personality traits that draw admirers and followers. However, to be effective leaders,
we all need to learn and grow continuously. Leadership development involves recog-
nising and identifying key skills and characteristics that are essential to becoming
11.6 How to Prevent Leaders from Being Drawn to the Dark Side                        267

a successful leader. In Primal leadership: Unleashing the power of emotional intel-
ligence (2002), Goleman et al. emphasise the importance of continual self-directed
learning, arguing that to master the repertoire of EI leadership skills and qualities
mentioned above, we need to invest time and effort into intentionally developing and
strengthening our leadership capabilities, through learning new knowledge, building
new skills, forming new habits and putting all of these into practice. This requires
genuinely knowing our real selves and our ideal selves, and understanding both the
change process and the steps needed to achieve change. People who can successfully
change in sustainable ways cycle through five discovery stages:

   Discovery 1: The ideal self. Who do I want to be?
   Discovery 2: My real self. Who am I? What are my strengths? What are the gaps
   I need to fill to take me from my real self to my ideal self?
   Discovery 3: My learning agenda. What do I need to do to build on my strengths
   while reducing the gaps?
   Discovery 4: Brain reprogramming. To achieve sustainable changes, we need
   to build new neural pathways through mastery. What are the new thoughts,
   behaviours and emotions I need to achieve these changes?
   Discovery 5: Develop trusting relationships to help, support and encourage each
   step in the process (Goleman et al., 2002, pp. 111–112).


11.6.2 Organisational Input to Boost EI

The literature also suggests that destructive leaders, even once identified and reported,
are often reluctant to change. It is then the organisation’s decision whether to tolerate
such individuals or remove them. Sometimes, clear policies and guidelines set up by
the organisation are helpful, as they can both motivate change and eliminate further
toxic influence by removing leaders who do more harm than good (Krasikova et al.,
2013; Rate & Sternberg, 2007). However, many dark leaders have powerful allies
and a strong influence on a network of powerful people.
    For decades, women have suffered gender bias, sexual harassment and misogyny
in the workplace. Sexual harassment and systemwide discrimination against women,
people of different racial backgrounds, people with disability and LGBTQIA people
has gone on for decades. It is shocking that such a systemic issue is not only allowed
to exist but proves to be ubiquitous across the globe when it is finally dragged out of
the shadows and thrust into the spotlight.
    One of the major barriers to acknowledging and addressing such appalling prac-
tices is fear. People knowingly turn a blind eye and refrain from engaging in honest
communication out of fear: of embarrassment, of humiliation, of being culturally
misunderstood or of being punished. And this only intensifies the culture of silence
in the workplace, perpetuating the illusion that some people, especially those in posi-
tions of power, are worthy of speaking and being heard while others do not deserve
a voice in matters that affect their welfare and wellbeing. Victims of harassments
268                                             11 Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

are often blamed or punished, leading them to feel shame, guilt and self-doubt,
and frequently to give up their job. Yet the alleged perpetrators usually get away
without any consequences. Silence can be considered a form of grooming. It create
a conducive environment that breeds more wrongdoing. Cultures of silence can be
changed, and it is not only up to victims to join together and advocate for their rights
as a group, but also up to organisations to take proactive action and set up mechanism
to prevent unlawful and unethical behaviour ruining the lives and happiness of other
staff members (Khurana & Gautam, 2018; Vreja et al., 2016).
   EI can be developed in the workplace. Organisations can learn to be emotionally
intelligent as connected entities, and systems can be put in place to support the
enhancement of organisational EI. These are:

   Organisational self-awareness: Board directors and top management, including
   HR personnel, must have a clear understanding of organisational values and
   mission, and how these are translated into everyday behaviour. They need to
   be alert to whether staff feel safe in expressing their needs and wants and able to
   be honest with their opinions and complaints. They need to put in place uncompli-
   cated grievance procedures staffed by professionals who are able to emotionally
   support complainants or victims of unjust treatment. They also need to know
   whether current policies and procedures are observed and acknowledged by all
   levels of staff.
   Organisational empathy: Every level of leadership and board governance body
   needs to know how the organisation works to benefit from diversity among its
   people. They need to keep abreast of what the organisation is doing to main-
   tain staff welfare and support staff in maintaining work-life balance—and how
   it is doing it—and look for evidence that it is genuinely open to learning from
   both the internal and external environment to build a supportive, friendly and
   compassionate work community.
   Organisational self-management: Top management and board directors need to
   know what mechanisms are in place for resolving conflict and whether they work.
   They need to be sensitive, unbiased, proactive in problem-solving and preventing
   the rise of dark leadership in the workplace, and to understand how emotionally
   intelligent its workforce is and what is needed to support the development of EI
   for individual and as a group. To do that, it is important that they know how to
   measure organisational EI, reinforce emotionally intelligent behaviour, encourage
   such practices, incorporate EI into their learning and development programs and
   measure the effectiveness of these training efforts.
   Organisational relationship management: There must be a vibrant under-
   standing of how people build trust in the organisation. Are there trust issues among
   staff, across different functional departments and at different levels? Do people
   feel respected, listened to and free to communicate honestly? Do staff members
   enjoy working in the workplace? Are they proud to be part of the organisation?
   Do functional departments build collaborative relationships with one another, and
   with external stakeholders, clients, customers and related communities?
11.6 How to Prevent Leaders from Being Drawn to the Dark Side                                    269

Attention to and interest in learning about and promoting collective EI is rising. The
literature on business and organisational studies is collecting evidence to show that
the development of collective EI is not only possible but important, and that it has a
significant impact on building a harmonious workplace culture. When all members
of an organisation are working with a higher level of EI, they are much more likely to
choose cooperation and collaboration over competition, and the organisation will gain
benefits in the form of improved work performance and productivity, and a happier
and healthier workforce (Clarke, 2010; Curşeu et al., 2015; Fernández-Berrocal et al.,
2014; Ofighi et al., 2015).

Practice Guide and Strategies
to Increase EI




12.1 Introduction

Emotional Intelligence (EI), as previously noted, is the capacity to recognise, under-
stand, and manage our own feelings so we can respond to those of others effectively
and positively. Chapter 1 of this book introduced the various popular models of EI
and explained that it is a capability that can be taught and learned. In 1995, Daniel
Goleman sparked global interest in EI with his book Emotional Intelligence: Why
It Can Matter More Than IQ, and since then, scholars from different disciplines
such as business management and leadership, organisational psychology, psychoso-
cial therapy and counselling, education, and personal wellbeing have contributed
further insights into how we can understand and apply EI in different aspects of our
lives. This chapter focuses on the four domains introduced by Goleman (1995) and
presents some practical guides and strategies to help readers to gain a broader and
deeper understanding and knowledge of the four domains of EI—self-awareness,
other awareness, self-management and relationship-management—and the ability
to apply them.



12.2 Self-Awareness

Self-awareness is not a modern construct. It was mentioned in Jesuit philosophy the
sixteenth century as one of the four pillars of success (Lowney, 2012). Those four
pillars were self-awareness, ingenuity, love, and heroism. The Jesuits believed that
through constant self-reflection, one could become both more self-aware and able to
discover one’s own blind spots and bad habits.
    What does self-awareness mean to you? There is an overabundance of definitions
in the literature that interpret ‘self-awareness’ through many different lenses. Here
are some examples:

• Self-awareness is the ability to reflect on and accurately assess one’s own
  behaviours and skills as they are manifested in workplace interactions
  (McCarthy & Garavan, 1999).
• Self-awareness is the capacity to become the object of one’s own attention (Morin,
  2006).
• Self-awareness is the capacity to allow one’s feelings, thoughts and behaviour
  into consciousness, especially in the context of a counsellor-client relationship
  (Oden et al., 2009).
• Self-awareness means knowing how one forms beliefs about oneself (Wilson and
  Dunn, 2004).
• Self-awareness is the awareness of one’s feelings, thoughts, reactions and personal
  values (Pompeo & Levitt, 2014).
• Self-awareness is the continuous process of understanding and knowing one’s
  own identity, beliefs, thoughts, traits, motivations, feelings and behaviour, and
  recognition of how they affect others; it also involves objectively examining one’s
  personal beliefs, attitudes, strengths and limitations (Rasheed, 2015).
• Self-awareness is the degree to which a person’s self-views reflect what they are
  really like (Sun & Vazire, 2019).
Goleman (1995) describes self-awareness as the ‘keystone’ of EI. He stresses the
importance of being able to recognise our own emotions and the impact they have on
our lives and those of the people around us, to being able to accurately identify our
strengths and limitations, and having self-confidence as a result of knowing our self-
worth and capabilities. These elements of EI are important not only in the workplace
but also in our personal lives, and in the relationships we build with our family,
friends and community.
    Psychology and sociology scholars have identified that we can gain self-awareness
by gaining understanding of our social behaviour and how we communicate with
others, and of the layers and dimensions of the self. We can gain understanding
of these layers and dimensions by developing our cognitive awareness—that is,
recognising our perceptions and how we form concepts and thoughts, understanding
that our behaviour is influenced or driven by our conscious and unconscious minds,
and recognising how our words and actions, and the way we communicate, affect
and impact others (Baumeister, 2005; Beck et al., 2004; Fromm, 1965).
    Rochat (2018) believes that self-awareness is a complex ability that is developed
progressively, in three levels. These are:
   Level 1—the identified self: As infants, we discover the self from our mirror
   image and begin to make links between the self as experienced from within, and
   the self that is displayed in the mirror.
   Level 2—the permanent self: As we gain more knowledge through our inter-
   actions with our environment and other people, we begin to form a self-identity,
   with a more developed sense of self-conception, self-referent cognition, and a
   greater understanding of our roles, responsibilities and social relationships.
   Level 3—the external self: After this, we learn that the ‘self’ is also seen by
   others and gradually develop the ability to both see ourselves more distinctly to
12.2 Self-Awareness                                                                 275

   understand who we are, and be aware of how others see us and how we fit into
   our social environment.
In a similar vein, Lane et al. (1990) view emotional self-awareness as a cognitive
skill and explain this concept using a developmental lens based on Piaget’s the five
developmental stages of human development. These stages include:
• Stage 1: The sensorimotor reflexive stage, in which the child has awareness of
  physical sensations but not the ability to explain or express them
• Stage 2: The sensorimotor enactive stage, in which the child becomes aware of
  body sensations and responses with action tendencies: cry to be picked up, smile
  at the sight of mum approaching.
• Stage 3: The pre-operational stage, in which the child is aware of their own feelings
  and able to name one emotion at a time (e.g., I feel sad, I feel afraid, etc.).
• Stage 4: The concrete operational stage, in which the child gains the ability to
  express a blend of emotions (e.g., I felt happy and worried at the same time when
  I got elected as the school captain).
• Stage 5: The formal operational stage, in which the child gains the ability to
  distinguish a blend of emotions in the self and others with a higher level of clarity
  and understanding (e.g., hurting another’s feelings due to one’s own insensitivity,
  and feeling guilty about it).
This school of thought helps to explain why some young children are not yet able to
understand or express their own and other’s emotions. It signals the importance of
helping children develop an understanding of their own and others’ emotions, and
the vocabulary and language needed to express those emotions. Developing a greater
emotional awareness can lead to greater behavioural and emotional control, and a
stronger ability to endure stress and deal with relationship and situational challenges.
   Researchers also argue that people who are low on self-awareness are at a tremen-
dous disadvantage and prone to stress and poor mental health (e.g., Bradberry &
Greaves, 2009). Goleman (2006) claims that people who fail to understand them-
selves are more likely to turn to less effective means of managing their moods and
emotions, and to experience anxiety, depression and even substance abuse. He adds
that self-awareness is a fundamental component of EI which helps us to manage our
unruly feelings and motivates us to think and take action. The better we understand
our emotions, the easier it is for us to work through problems.
   However, developing self-awareness and applying the strategies we need to change
our behaviour is a process that requires commitment and perseverance. As human
beings, we grow and change as we gain new experiences, move into different envi-
ronments, and interact with different people. Self-awareness is a life-long aptitude
that continues to develop as we come to an understanding of our unique strengths
and limitations, core values, beliefs and desires.
   Self-awareness can be quantified or assessed with scientific measures, though
these may not totally reflect our true selves. In the commercial world, large corpo-
rate and government organisations employ tools such as 360-degree and multi-rater
276                                        12 Practice Guide and Strategies to Increase EI

assessments to help us see ourselves better by rating our capabilities using measure-
ment scales, so that we can then think more clearly about how we behave and perform.
These measurement tools also require co-workers and other stakeholders in the work
environment to rate us so that we gain an understanding of how we are seen by
others. Today, as HR specialists and organisational psychologists fine-tuned their
assessment and reporting skills, more and more people are finding these 360-degree
tools helpful for their growth and development of both work skills and people skills
in the workplace.
    For our own personal growth and development, making self-awareness a habit can
help to increase our self-confidence and self-worth, and so help us achieve success.
It requires us to become more objective in our thinking and develop a self-distanced
perspective in order to understand our underlying emotions and what they are telling
us, and not dwell on previous relational conflicts and the emotions we experienced
during past events. To become more self-aware, we need to develop an understanding
of ourselves in different aspects, such as our personality traits, our personal values,
our emotions, the psychological needs that drive our behaviours, and our habits
(Duval & Silvia, 2002; Kross et al., 2005).
    There are numerous models, strategies and checklists available to help people
develop self-awareness. A list of resources is given at the end of this chapter to give
you access to a comprehensive range of tools to develop insights and skills. Some of
the more common methods mentioned in the literature include:
• Knowing your strengths and limitations: You can make a list of your perceived
  strengths and weaknesses, ask your family and friends for feedback, or complete
  formal assessments such as personality tests that are available through work,
  school, universities or counsellors.
• Understand your roles and responsibilities: We all wear different hats in
  different situations. Try to list all the roles you play in your life, as a son,
  daughter, spouse, work-partner, professional, sibling, parent, etc. Part II of this
  book provided a comprehensive discussion of the different aspects of our rela-
  tionships with our family, spouses, siblings and friends, which may help you gain
  more insight into your roles and responsibilities in the different parts you play in
  your life journey.
• Learn how to name your emotions: Get into the habit of engaging in self-
  reflection from time to time, whether you are happy, frustrated or sad. When we
  are able to name our emotions, we can take a step back from them and appreciate
  the feeling or mood we are experiencing in a particular situation, and think about
  what we can learn from it or how to deal with it in the present or future.
• Know your values, beliefs and assumptions: Knowing what is important to you
  in your life—what you believe in—is an essential part of self-knowledge. Dig deep
  to examine some assumptions you have about yourself (e.g., I am fat and nerdy,
  I will never find a husband). Sometimes we are blinded by our assumptions and
  blame others for our misfortunes, or hide behind them to avoid changing. Learn
  to recognise some productive and unproductive assumptions you hold and think
  about how they might be affecting you.
12.2 Self-Awareness                                                               277

• Identify your self-enhancing and self-destructive behaviours: Life is like a
  yin-yang symbol. We all have a bright side and a dark side. It is important to be
  able to recognise both your ‘good self’ and your ‘bad self’. How do you react
  in a challenging situation? What drives your behaviour? What sort of defence
  mechanisms do you use to protect yourself? What do you need to work on to
  change unhelpful behaviours?


12.3 Other Awareness (Social Intelligence)

Another key component of EI is other awareness. When we are able to understand
ourselves, our emotional needs and how our emotions impact us in different situa-
tions, we can learn to bring that awareness to managing our relationships with others.
Other awareness is also known as social intelligence. This notion was first introduced
by American psychologist Edward Thorndike in the 1920s; he described it as the
ability to read and react to social signals and understand, monitor and manage one’s
own emotions to fit into a range of social contexts (Thorndike, 1920). He observed
that human babies exhibit social intelligence at the age of 6 weeks, and by 18 months
they are able to understand complex social cues and others’ intentions. However, as
we get older, our social environment becomes more dynamic and complex, and this
can be a challenge for people who do not acquire social intelligence easily. Never-
theless, Thorndike claimed that social intelligence is a skill that we can learn, and
that we can significantly benefit from doing so.



12.3.1 The Neuroscience of Social Intelligence

Neuroscience has discovered that the human brain is literally wired to connect with
others, and there are neurobiological components to the experience of empathy.
Research suggests that we possess neurons that allow us to learn through the obser-
vation and imitation of facial expressions and how people behave in different situ-
ations. These neurons, known as mirror neurons, are found in the frontal lobe of
the brain. They enable us to identify the emotions and moods of others and help
us to understand them. In other words, our brains are constantly responding to our
environment, monitoring what is happening in other people and helping us to track
their emotions. This explains the common expression ‘to be on the same wavelength
as someone’.
   And emotions are infectious. When we are among happy people, we are generally
happy, and when we are in the company of sad people, we will be affected by their
sadness. This is why Goleman (2006) pointed out that leaders have to be aware
of their emotional states and moods because these influence how their staff feel.
He reiterates that work supervisors who want their teams to become productive
must lift their moods and motivate them using positive thoughts and encouragement.
278                                       12 Practice Guide and Strategies to Increase EI

Likewise, teachers and parents need to be aware of how their emotional states affect
their children, especially when they are in a learning state.



12.3.2 The Different Aspects of Social Intelligence

Some of the more popular writings on social intelligence include
• Karl Albrecht’s Social intelligence: The new science of success (2006),
• Chris Peterson and Martin Seligman’s Character strengths and virtues: A
  handbook and classification (2004) and
• Daniel Goleman’s Social intelligence: The new science of human relationships
  (2006).
Albrecht (2006) observed how successful business leaders with a high level of social
intelligence were able to influence others, while those low on social intelligence
caused their staff and followers agony and stress. He created a model of social
intelligence with the acronym S.P.A.C.E. to illustrate how the development of these
skills increases social intelligence and subsequently impacts others positively.
•   S: Situational awareness
•   P: Presence
•   A: Authenticity
•   C: Clarity
•   E: Empathy
Peter and Seligman (2004) described social intelligence as a character strength that
is characterised by six virtues:
• Wisdom: the cognitive strength needed to acquire and use of knowledge.
• Courage: the emotional strength and determination needed to overcome adversity
  and achieve goals.
• Humanity: the interpersonal strength needed to build relationships and support
  others.
• Transcendence: the spiritual strength needed to connect with the universe and
  find meaning.
• Justice: the strong sense of civic responsibility needed to foster the foundations
  of a healthy community life.
• Temperance: the strength of self-discipline needed to protect against excess.
Goleman (2006) further proposed that social intelligence comprises two aspects:
social awareness and social facilitation. Social awareness refers to the ability to
sense someone else’s inner state and understand their feelings and thoughts and why
they feel the way they do.
   Social awareness as described by Goleman, encompasses:
12.3 Other Awareness (Social Intelligence)                                          279

• Attunement: the ability to tune in to a person’s feelings through attentive and
  receptive listening.
• Primal empathy: the ability to sense another’s feelings based on observation and
  visual cues.
• Empathic accuracy: the ability to understand not only someone’s thoughts and
  feelings, but also their intentions.
• Social cognition: the knowledge and understanding of how the social world works.
Social facilitation explains that we tend to perform differently when we are around
others and when we know that our work is appreciated. For example, performers
on stage put in more energy when they receive applause and cheers from the audi-
ence. When we work side by side with a buddy or a co-worker, we can facilitate
(consciously or unconsciously) positive energy and motivation to encourage one
another, leading to higher productivity and increased chances of success.
    According to McLeod (2020), the concept of social facilitation was first introduced
by in 1898 by Norman Triplett, who noted that cyclists’ performance was facilitated
when they trained as a group. There are two types of social facilitation, the co-action
effect (i.e., when people work together to achieve a task they do better than when
they work on it alone) and the audience effect (i.e., we are more motivated when
we have someone to show appreciation of what we do). However, some people feel
nervous and tense and are prone to make more errors when they are being observed
in their task performance. As a result, they perform less well than when they work
alone, leading them to view themselves with increased self-doubt. This is described
as social inhibition (Shrestha, 2017).
    Subsequent psychology scholars have added further observations of social facil-
itation to the literature (e.g., Forgas et al., 1980; Strauss, 2002; Zajonc, 1965). They
claim that social facilitation involves:
• Self-presentation: the ability to present oneself in accordance with the expecta-
  tions of others based on the role one plays.
• Synchrony: the ability to build rapport with others through non-verbal language
  and cues.
• Concern: the ability to demonstrate care and respond to the needs of others.
• Influence: the ability to shape the outcomes of social interactions.
When we increase our self-awareness and social intelligence, we become better
able to understand our emotional and behavioural responses in different circum-
stances, and understand what affects us physically (drive and arousal), cognitively
(distraction and attention) and affectively (anxiety and self-presentation). Then we
can understand more clearly how to improve ourselves.

12.3.3 Empathy

Empathy is a major component of social intelligence. It is the ability to emotionally
understand how other people feel and see things from their point of view, and it
enables us to build social connections with others, drives us to make active attempts
to understand them, and promotes helping behaviour. Scientists tell us that the ability
to show empathy is influenced by genetics, and that women are more likely to pick
up on emotional cues accurately than men (Demetriou, 2018). A scientific research
has identified that the gene LRRNI on Chromosome 3, which is an active part of
the brain called the Striatum, is related to our capacity to empathise (Warrier et al.,
2018). Functional MRI research has also found that the inferior frontal gyrus plays
a critical role in the experience of empathy, and that people with damage to this area
of the brain generally find it hard to show empathy and have difficulty understanding
the emotions of others (Hillis, 2014; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009).
    There are many people who are unable to show empathy and respond with indif-
ference or even hostility when they see others suffering or struggling to deal with
challenges. In addition to physiological reasons caused by conditions linked to the
dysfunction of part of the frontal lobe of the brain, there can be a range of reasons
for this apathy. It can relate to a person’s upbringing and an absence of role models
to learn from. It may be due to negative and harsh life experiences that have shaped
the individual to become bitter, unkind and inconsiderate. It can be due to a lack of
sensitivity and other-awareness for those who are low on EI or who do not have the
skills to handle emotional situations and therefore choose to shy away due to the
fear of being overwhelmed. It may also be due to cognitive biases due to exposure to
misinformation, prejudice and discriminatory thoughts and beliefs, or a preference
for following the crowd (e.g., on social media), or a thinking pattern that does not
consider facts in a logical and rational manner.
    However, social scientists have also proven that for those who are not geneti-
cally endowed with natural empathy, it is an attitude and a skill that can be learned
and developed (Hodges & Myers, 2007; Ratka, 2018). Psychologist Albert Bandura
proposed a Social Learning Theory (1977) which suggested that people can increase
their social intelligence and capacity for empathy through observation, imitation
and modelling based on the people around them. People can increase their expe-
rience and practice of empathy by taking the time to listen to others, observing
their responses and reactions in different social and formal situations, and learning
additional communication skills to improve their understanding of others.
    The literature on empathy presents three kinds of empathy: affective empathy,
cognitive empathy, and somatic empathy.
   Affective empathy: This is the ability to understand another person’s emotions
   and feel concerned for their wellbeing, and show a willingness to help.
   Cognitive empathy: This is the ability to take on another person’s perspec-
   tive without being emotional ourselves. For example, in a personal or a work-
   related conflict, when we have cognitive empathy, we may become more broad-
   minded and take our opponent’s viewpoint into consideration. Cognitive empathy
12.3 Other Awareness (Social Intelligence)                                            281

   is important especially for people in the helping industry, such as psychologists
   and counsellors, social workers and teachers.
   Somatic empathy: This involves physically sharing the emotions of another
   person, for example, crying when we see another person crying, or sharing joy,
   laughter and fun when among a joyful group of people who are laughing and
   rejoicing.
Having a balance of cognitive and affective empathy can help us establish better
relationships with the people we love, our friends and the people we work with.
When people feel heard and understood, they are more willing to establish trusting
emotional connections with us and working in a more collaborative manner. When
we have the capacity to show and exercise cognitive and affective empathy in balance,
we can make people feel safe, identify their needs and help them solve problems.
   And as noted above, empathy is a skill that can be learned, developed and
improved. We can strengthen our empathy and social intelligence by:
• learning to communicate and develop a repertoire of communication skills.
• thinking before we act, and learning to curb our impulsive reactions, especially
  when emotional or tense.
• being mindful of our own reactions, body language and tone of voice.
• being mindful of others’ body language, non-verbal cues, tone of voice and
  situation.
• reflecting on events that have triggered emotional tension or conflict.
• learning from the past by keeping a journal of what has worked and what has
  triggered negative emotional responses in us and others.
• learning the skills of emotional mapping (i.e., naming the emotions we feel and
  the emotions that we have observed in others, especially in conflict, and trying to
  understand the triggers).
Some people appear to be able to naturally exude empathy, and demonstrate the ability
to effortlessly put someone at ease and build trust. Some of us may need to put in some
effort and time to boost our EI and become more empathetic. But with perseverance,
time and perhaps some professional coaching, we can improve our empathy skills
exponentially and enjoy building rewarding friendships and relationships.



12.3.4 Social Skills

Social skills are part of our social intelligence. The involve utilising our social cogni-
tion and knowledge of social facilitation to decide when and how to listen, and what to
say and what to do in different situations so that we can build and maintain healthy and
positive relationships. It comprises social and emotional learning, how we recognise
and manage our emotions, and how we form different behaviour patterns in different
social situations, facilitate interaction and communication, establish relationships
282                                         12 Practice Guide and Strategies to Increase EI

with others, follow and observe social rules and use social cues to make decisions
and handle relationship challenges (Kabasakal & Çelik, 2010).
   People who do not have strong social skills tend to face problems with interper-
sonal interactions and feel socially awkward in social and workplace communica-
tions. With a sufficient set of social skills, however, we can enhance our personal
development and human connections, productivity, employability and career success.
Individuals who are competent in using their social skills are able to follow patterns
of behaviour that facilitate understanding and caring for others, enriching communi-
cation skills, and effortlessly building rapport with people. Acquiring essential social
skills involves learning and understanding the social rules, attitudes and beliefs of
our society, including verbal and non-verbal symbols, language and communication
modes (Borghans et al., 2006; Hops, 1983; Segrin, 2001).
   We begin to learn social skills as children through our interactions with our family
and other children at school. The building-blocks for early acquisition of social skills
include:
• Play skills: learning how other children behave at play; learning to take turns and
  observe rules.
• Pre-language skills: understanding non-verbal cues by observing other people’s
  body language and facial expressions, and recognising pleasure and displeasure
  based on these experiences.
• Attention and concentration: learning to focus on activities and ignore distrac-
  tion, and to develop patience to complete a task with sustained effort.
• Receptive language: learning to listen and understand spoken language and detect
  emotions through tone of voice, volume and pitch.
• Expressive language: learning how to express ourselves with language, speech
  and tone of voice.
• Executive function: learning to develop our cognitive functions by strengthening
  our attention and memory and developing skills to perform planned tasks.
• Self-regulation: learning to control our emotions and behaviour in different social
  situations.
Children with weak social skills might have difficulty making friends, maintaining
friendships with peers and communicating effectively with others who are unfa-
miliar to them. They may also have difficulty expressing their needs and wants and
their emotions, interpreting social situations, and understanding jokes or figurative
language. Some may have difficulty regulating their emotions in public, dealing with
conflict or coping with failure. Many will even carry these social skill deficits into
adulthood, where they may encounter more problems in their interpersonal relation-
ships with family, friends and colleagues. As a result, they risk facing peer rejection
or developing social anxiety, or other mental health issues such as aggression and
anxiety.
    Some people with introverted personality types may not choose to behave in the
same vivacious and bubbly way as their extroverted counterparts, but this does not
mean that they have less strong social skills. Many social introverts prefer to interact
in small groups and feel awkward or anxious in larger groups like a wedding party
12.3 Other Awareness (Social Intelligence)                                            283

or business conference. Some appear shy and uneasy when they have to make small
talk with strangers or feel drained after a short period of interaction with people. This
may mean they appear aloof and unfriendly, so it can be an advantage for introverted
individuals to practise being confident in large groups, or develop tactful ways to
avoid misunderstandings. That itself is a social skill!
   There are a myriad of strategies and approaches to help people strengthen their
social skills. Many of these were developed by shy or ‘socially awkward’ people
who were looking for ways to overcome the difficulties they experienced in coping
with social demands. The following are some of these strategies and approaches:
   Communicating with and understanding others: There are lots of programs and
   social skills training sessions that people can attend to strengthen their communi-
   cation skills. Some good examples include improving adolescent social compe-
   tence and peer interactions, social skills training in groups and 101 ways to
   improve communication skills.
   Meeting, mingling and caring: We all learn when we are having fun. When we
   can buddy up with some caring friends and develop appropriate social skills by
   observing them as they mingle and meet other friends in different group situa-
   tions, we can easily pick up helpful interpersonal and social skills. There are also
   therapeutic programs for individuals with emotional and behavioural challenges
   or mental health issues that use this form of social training.
   Taking the initiatives: This is a popular cognitive-behavioural approach used
   by school counsellors and therapists for socially anxious individuals. After being
   taught how to take the initiatives and develop relevant skills, students and ‘patients’
   learn how to apply these skills in their daily lives and gain feedback and encour-
   agement from their social worker, school counsellor or family therapist (Chung &
   Watkins, 1995; Yildirim, 2006).
   Creating an environment of confidence: When parents and teachers are able
   to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to create a safe environment that
   nurtures students to develop more self-confidence and social awareness, students
   who have difficulties in adapting to their social environment can gradually and
   progressively develop their social and interpersonal skills and self-reliance, and
   grow comfortable behaving more boldly and proactively (Shapiro, 2004). The
   same is true for support groups set up to assist those with social anxiety.
   Getting rid of irrational beliefs: Some people are uncomfortable around others
   because they have low self-esteem or have lost trust in people due to past pain
   and hurtful experiences. Talking to a professional (e.g. a coach or psychologist)
   may help them to clarify issues and reduce the fears and negative thoughts that
   hinder social participations or relationship building (Ellis, 2004).
   Developing a sense of responsibility: Some people experience social rejections
   because they are not aware that their social behaviours are unacceptable. Such
   behaviours can include rudeness, disrespect for others, racism, misogyny or self-
   absorption. These social skill deficits may be a result of having negative role
   models in their upbringing or being treated rudely and unkindly by others, which
   can lead to low self-esteem, self-hatred and feeling angry at the whole world.
284                                         12 Practice Guide and Strategies to Increase EI

   These individuals may need more time and effort to learn about themselves, let
   go of their skewed views and attitudes and unlearn their anti-social behaviours.
   They need to take responsibility for their lack of social awareness and develop new
   attitudes and skills so that they can fit in socially again (Burch, 2003; Lickona,
   2004). Having a solid set of social skills enables us to connect with others and
   build friendships and mutually beneficial relationships. We can all benefit from
   strengthening our social and people skills at different stages of our lives.


12.4 Self-Management

Self-management is a significant component of EI. It refers to our ability to control
impulsive responses and behaviour, manage our emotions in helpful ways, adapt to
changing circumstances, take the initiative and follow through on commitments. Self-
management capabilities include self-control, honesty and transparency, adaptability,
achievement and optimism.



12.4.1 Self-Control

Self-control is our ability to regulate our impulsive and irrational responses in order
to steer clear of undesirable behaviours. It includes avoiding temptation and delaying
gratification, and developing and increasing desirable traits such as eating a healthy
diet, exercising regularly, being aware of our bad habits and eliminating them, devel-
oping perseverance and self-discipline, setting worthwhile goals achieving them.
Exercising self-control can be a challenge for many of us. When we become more
self-aware of our bad behaviour and really want to make changes, we must set achiev-
able goals and work towards them step by step. It can be easier if we share these goals
with our loved ones, our friends, or mentors, coaches or teachers, as these people
can help us monitor our progress and encourage us to persist and achieve.
    Self-control and self-regulation also require metacognitive skills. People with
higher metacognitive abilities are more able to overcome setbacks and make the
necessary changes to complete tasks and achieve goals, because they know how to
assess their thought process and reframe the way they think to meet the demands of
their new situations. Metacognitive skills include knowing our own learning styles,
abilities and needs, and knowing how to plan effectively, access resources required,
organise our time, space, resources and human support, monitor our progress,
learn from our mistakes, evaluate our task success and change our strategies to
adjust to different pressures or difficulties. It also requires us to engage in critical
thinking, lateral thinking and creative thinking to make decisions and solve problems
encountered.
    To put self-control and self-regulation into practice, we can:
12.4 Self-Management                                                               285

•   be mindful of our thoughts and feelings.
•   practice our communication skills.
•   use cognitive reframing to change our thought patterns and emotional responses.
•   build our distress tolerance skills.
•   find ways to manage our difficult emotions.
•   look at challenges as opportunities.
•   recognise that we have a choice in how we respond to challenging situations.
•   work on accepting our emotions.
Having the resilience needed to overcome difficulties and setback is an advantage
in life. People who are more resilient can bounce back from failures more easily,
and try again with more determination, a stronger sense of purpose, hopefulness and
positive self-talk.



12.4.2 Honesty and Transparency

Being honest means being truthful, trustworthy and open. It also means being true
to ourselves, and not pretending to be someone we are not. It means upholding
what we believe in with integrity and living by our highest values, and behaving
in a moral, ethical way even when no one is watching. People with integrity are
dependable, responsible, trustworthy, reliable, thoughtful towards others, respectful,
and committed to doing the right thing even if they are tempted with gains and perks.
It is sometimes a tall order to be totally honest, as we all lie a little in one way or
another. What matters is being honest with ourselves and making an effort to be open
and truthful with others as much as we can.
    Transparency is a term more commonly used to describe work relationships,
especially in leadership. It is essential to establish trust among the people we work
with. A person who is ‘transparent’ has nothing to hide; leaders who are transparent
show empathy and compassion to the people they work with, genuinely listen to
others and do not shy away from criticisms, and invite suggestions and opinions in
a positive and open way. They are willing to confront difficult situations, take risks
and bear the consequences of their decisions. They provide access to information,
communicate goals, procedures and processes clearly and do not sweep bad news or
mistakes under the carpet. They also consult and involve people in making important
decisions, and value openness, accountability and communication.



12.4.3 Adaptability

Adaptability is the ability to rapidly learn new behaviours and skills in order to
respond to changing circumstances in our lives. We all go through different changes
and face new demands at different stages of our lives—moving from toddlerhood
286                                         12 Practice Guide and Strategies to Increase EI

to going to ‘big school’, moving from childhood to adolescence and then into the
multi-faceted demands of adulthood, building our career, getting married, starting a
family, being parents, getting promotions, changing jobs, moving to other countries,
etc. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a big test of our adaptability due to mobility
restrictions, the need to working from home, worries about health threats, and being
separated from our friends and relatives due to lockdown rules (Tu et al., 2020).
    Even without exceptional challenges such as this, we all need to take a breath and
step out of our comfort zone to do something new sometimes. That requires courage
and adaptability. Being adaptable means working without limitations on our thinking
and actions, and not becoming overwhelmed by changes and giving in to dread of the
unknown. It means choosing to embrace challenge and being open to finding diverse
and unexpected solutions to problems in our lives, our relationships and our work.
And it means not being afraid to start over when we suffer from harsh adversity, such
as fires, war or the loss of a loved one to death or relationship breakdown.
    In the workplace, adaptable leaders are the ones who can identify where change is
necessary for the betterment of the organisation and business. They are the ones who
remain positive in times of challenges and hardship, and keep their teams motivated.
They are open-minded and willing to consider solutions from different points of
view, and value contributions from staff members at every level. People who are
adaptable do not grow old because they have a growth mindset and make sure to
keep pace with the changing times. Adaptable leaders and workers are willing to try
different strategies and use different tools to achieve the best outcomes. They are
positive thinkers who believe that if there is a will, there is a way (Reupert et al.,
2017).
    We can all become more adaptable by observing how others combat adversity
and remain strong, and developing a positive and optimistic ‘Yes we can!’ mindset.
Always be on the lookout for the silver linings when you are weathering heavy
storms. Be willing to make mistakes and learn from them. And, as Steve Jobs once
said, ‘Be curious, be hungry’. Having a curious mind leads us to want more in our
lives. When we are hungry for a needed change, we will not be deterred by setbacks
but learn new ways to adapt and find solutions to achieve our goals (Price-Robertson
et al., 2017).



12.4.4 Achievement

A strong desire to achieve is the difference between being ordinary and being
outstanding. Achievements are the building blocks to success in life. Superstars like
Angela Merkle, Mohammed Ali, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Barack and Michelle
Obama, all have a strong drive to achieve, which helped them overcome negative
forces that placed obstacles in their journey to success. Their self-confidence, convic-
tion and desire to achieve propelled them to rise up time and time again, dust off
the dirt, lick their wounds and start again. People with a strong sense of achieve-
ment do not buy into instant gratification. They are emotionally strong and aware of
12.4 Self-Management                                                                287

their strengths and limitations, and know how to develop themselves at different life
stages and points in their careers. They have attitudes and abilities that include self-
awareness, open-mindedness, self-advocacy, problem-solving and relational skills,
which are the core requirements for them to take charge of their lives. And above all,
their desire to success is not self-focused, but is aimed at the common good. They
have the growth mindset and intelligence necessary to set goals, evaluate options and
make the right choices to achieve their goals.



12.4.5 Optimism

The dictionary definition of optimism is ‘a disposition or tendency to look on a more
favourable side of events to expect the most favourable outcome’. However, Goleman
and Davidson (2017) inform us that optimism, which is a form of social cognition,
is a skill that can be learned and developed.
    Scholars have proven that optimism is a mental attitude that strongly influences
our physical and mental health (e.g., Aspinwall et al., 2001; Martínez-Correa et al.,
2006; Matthews et al., 2004). Using patient recovery rates and survival chances
as evidence, medical studies show us that patients who are optimistic are signifi-
cantly more successful in their recovery from life-threatening diseases such as cancer
and cardiovascular health concern then those who hold more pessimistic attitudes
(Rasmussen et al., 2006; Steele & Wade, 2004). Scheier and Carver (1985) claimed
that optimistic patients actively look for coping strategies and social supports to help
them recover, while pessimistic patients who felt hopeless showed more somatic
complaints (Martínez-Correa et al., 2006). Schou et al. (2005) found that optimistic
women with breast cancer showed coping strategies characterised by acceptance of
the situation and hopeful beliefs, and learned to alleviate their worries by engaging
in fun and relaxing activities, enjoying companionship and time with loved ones, and
having a strong sense of humour; all of these qualities led to improvements in their
quality of life, and for some, recovery from their health challenges.
    In addition to the correlation between optimism and health, business studies have
also found that optimism influences entrepreneurial success, and helps stressful
people to overcome challenges by using humour to reframe their thoughts and accep-
tance strategies to cope with difficulties that they deemed uncontrollable). Some
scholars have also found that optimism is an attribute of classroom success, espe-
cially amongst socio-economically disadvantaged students, and that teachers who are
optimistic are able to have a positive influence on their students, leading to learning
improvement and academic success (Beard et al., 2010; Crane & Crane, 2007; Hoy
et al., 2006; Thomas, 2011).
    Happily, psychologists and scholars in the field of organisational behaviour inform
us that optimism can be learned (Meevissen et al., 2011; Miller, 2001; Peters et al.,
2010; Seligman, 2011). Here are some of the strategies found in the literature:
288                                        12 Practice Guide and Strategies to Increase EI

• Adopt a growth mindset and positive thinking
• Practise ignoring negative thoughts and switching to thinking of something
  pleasant as soon as some negative thoughts come to your mind
• Consider what went well instead of just focusing on what went wrong.
• Set realistic goals and expectations, and adopt a ‘Plan B’ thinking mode.
• Record periodic progress when pursuing a long-term goal (e.g., weekly, monthly).
• Practice gratitude. People who are religious can thank their God for guidance,
  and people who are not can be thankful that good things have happened and be
  grateful for what they have.
• Refrain from negative rumination, and let bygones be bygones. We all make
  mistakes. Move on.
• Find the positive in difficult situations wherever and whenever possible.
• Remember that you can’t control others or change them. You can only manage
  your emotions and how you respond to people who hurt you or are not nice to
  you.
• Take action on the things you can control.
• Surround yourself with optimistic people and reduce contact with negative
  individuals who are always finding fault or complaining.
• Remember to smile. It can change your mood.
• Anticipate with excitement. Be like a child again—got excited about little
  advantages like learning to cook something new or attending a special event.
• And remember that nothing is permanent. Things will change in time. Sometimes
  we have to endure the unknown and some amount of suffering related to the
  challenges you are facing, but it will always pass. Look for the light at the end of
  the tunnel.
At the work level, EI and social intelligence involve not only interpersonal skills but
our understanding of the organisation (workplace) as a whole. Many people, espe-
cially professionals such as teachers, nurses, doctors and lawyers are very focused
on their technical and professional skills and not mindful enough of the relational
aspects of their work life. It is time we all started to think not only as individual
contributors, but also as pillars of the organisations we belong to. Understanding
and facilitating relationship harmony is crucial to a happy and healthy work life.
The following section therefore presents two key organisation (workplace) social
intelligence skills that are helpful for leadership and work harmony.



12.5 Organizational Awareness

Goleman and Davidson (2017) tell us that if we want to excel in our workplace or
business, we must have adequate knowledge of the organisation we work in. This
involves having the ability to connect with our colleagues, co-workers, bosses and
supervisors, clients and other stakeholders, and a grasp of the power relationships,
influencers, cliques, networks and dynamics within the organisation. The authors
12.5 Organizational Awareness                                                          289

also alert us that people with ‘organisational attention deficit’ are likely to miss out
on the data they need to make sound decisions, and not be able to focus energy on
things that matter in the workplace. The three areas we need to observe and develop
to have good organisational awareness are:
1.     an internal awareness of factors that most people do not really pay attention to,
       such as the emotional climate and people’s collective mood and enthusiasm.
2.     the relational dynamics from staff groups to external suppliers and competitors.
3.     the economic and political climate and forces that influence the organisation or
       workplace.
Goleman also indicates that when we are able to recognise networking opportunities
and observe key power relationships, we are better equipped to handle the demands
of the workplace. When we are aware of the guiding values and unspoken rules in
operation and develop our organisational awareness competency, we will be better
able to sense the personal networks that make the organisation run, know how to gain
support from the right people in order to make key decisions, and form partnerships
to get something done.
    Organisational awareness is especially important for people who are external to
an organisation, such as IT support, project managers and teams, HR contractors
and coaching consultants. Having a big-picture understanding of the organisational
structure, policies and procedures, and taking the time to zoom in on and understand
its human relationship dynamics and the complexity of interactions among individ-
uals, teams and departments, will help external contractors gain more insight into
the solutions the organisation is looking for and help them to meet goals.



12.6 Relational Management

Goleman et al. (2002) introduced the concept of ‘primal leadership’ and explained
that a leader’s primal task is an emotional one—to reach people with a sense
of purpose by motivating them with goals and messages that resonate with their
emotional reality, and support them at both an emotional and a relational level. To do
that, leaders must develop not only EI, but also social intelligence and relationship
management skills. Some of these skills include:
     Knowing how to inspire: This involves knowing what is important to staff
     members and aligning organisational goals by sharing a compelling vision and a
     sense of common purpose that will engage teams and support them in achieving
     these goals.
     Developing skills in influence: This involves developing proficiencies in commu-
     nication in order to persuade and engage others by showing respect for their talents
     and appreciation for their hard work, in order to gain buy-ins for plans and projects.
     Knowing how to develop others: This requires an understanding of the personal
     aspirations of different members of staff and an understanding of their skills,
290                                        12 Practice Guide and Strategies to Increase EI

   talents, strengths and development needs. It also involves developing strong
   communication skills in order to give constructive feedback, handle conflict and
   energise others.
   Becoming a change catalyst: We live in a fast-changing world that demands that
   we not only to be able to accept and cope with change but also lead change. Facing
   change is a highly emotional challenge. Leaders and work colleagues who have
   the skills and talents to support others are therefore assets to an organisation. An
   effective change catalyst can create not only a sense of urgency that convinces
   others that change is necessary, but also a safe environment to lead them through
   the progressive change process.
   Knowing how to manage conflict: Conflict is inevitable, whether in our personal
   life or our work life, and knowing how to manage conflict is a necessary survival
   skill. Instead of avoiding conflict, we need to develop competence to address
   it by understanding different perspectives, identifying common ground for all
   parties involved and finding solutions that benefit everyone. At the same time, it
   is important to support those who suffer stress and anxiety caused by conflict.
   Develop skills in leading teamwork and collaboration: Leaders at all levels
   need to develop teamwork and collaboration skills, and teach and mentor team
   members in how to be team players. Those who can model respect, helpfulness
   and cooperation with others are able to build active, enthusiastic commitment,
   generate team spirit and collective effort, and form a team identity.
This chapter has presented some practical strategies and guides for how to develop
and boost our EI. Some readers may find some of the elements discussed a bit too
idealistic, but we stand at different points along the development spectrum in our
personal and professional life, and idealism can inspire people and mobilise them to
take action. It is also important to be realistic, though. Ask yourself: How far am I
from my ideal self? What is possible and doable? What do I need to change? What
can I do on my own and what do I need help with? How and where can I get support?
What are the transitional challenges?
   Decide for yourself what you want to achieve. Success comes over time, not
overnight. Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. Believe and
achieve.

Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent
Mental Health




13.1 Introduction

Our mental health is just as important as our physical health. Good mental health is
vital for healthy adolescent development. A high level of emotional intelligence is
associated with good mental health. Children and adolescents who are emotion-
ally intelligent are more positive about themselves, have healthier relationships
with family and friends, are able to cope with changes and challenges, and gener-
ally feel happier and optimistic. This chapter discusses how schools can help to
increase students’ social-emotional intelligence by using a combination of EI models.
Evidence-based data are presented to illustrate how youth mental issues can be
prevented with emotional intelligence skills and competence. Complemented with
research data, the chapter also discusses the effectiveness of some school programs
used internationally, and how they benefit students in the improvement of their mental
health and wellbeing.



13.2 Adolescent Mental Health and EI

Mental health refers to our cognitive, emotional and behavioural wellbeing. Some
scholars viewed mental health as the positive adaptive functioning to one’s environ-
ment, and the adaptivity to cope with changes of mood (Campbell-Sills et al., 2006).
The World Health Organization (1979) defines mental health as a “state of well-
being whereby individuals recognize their abilities, are able to cope with the normal
stresses of life, work productively and fruitfully, and make a contribution to their
communities.” The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1999) defines
mental health as: “Basic cognitive and social skills; ability to recognize, express and
modulate one’s own emotions, as well as empathize with others; flexibility and ability
to cope with adverse life events and function in social role.” And the Scottish Public
Mental Health Alliance (SCOTPHO, 2012) describes mental health as “a positive

resource that enables one to cope with life’s demanding conditions and identified
sense of self-worth and esteem, empathy, the ability to express emotions, to form
and maintain healthy relationships, and to effectively communicate with others.”
    As young people transition from childhood to adulthood, they go through a
unique period of multiple changes: physical, psychological, social, and emotional.
Their developing sense of self and emotional competence corresponds to their envi-
ronmental demands and influences. Coping and adapting to these changes can
be distressing and challenging at times. Normative and maladaptive thinking and
behavioural patterns can shape their future. Good mental health helps young people
to have a greater sense of calm and inner peace, increase their self-esteem and
self-confidence, have clearer thinking, manage their moods, and cope with changes.
    Being a teenager can be exciting and challenging. Life for them can be sweet,
embarrassing, awkward, and everything in between. For some, it is a dilemma because
sometimes they are still treated as children, but at other times they are expected to act
like adults. Mental health issues are common amongst adolescents because they are
still learning to cope with new experiences. These common issues include feeling
stressed, having low self-esteem, loneliness, having relationship issues at home,
self-image challenges, academic and school pressure, and some may have financial
worries. Some of these challenges may be temporary, and with support from adults,
many young people would learn coping strategies and move on with their lives.
However, the effect of cumulative stress may become a risk factor leading to mental
health issues. Young people who do not know how to get help or advice may resort
to escapist behaviour and develop mental health challenges like eating disorders,
digital addiction, school bullying, substance abuse, self-harm, and may even have
suicidal thoughts.



13.2.1 Eating Disorders

The teenage years can be exhilarating and trying. During this period, teenagers are
learning to adapt and cope with challenges and new experiences. Some may turn to
food for comfort, while others may pay too much attention to their changing body
image and refrain from eating proper healthy meals. Eating disorders in young people
have become an increasing problem in our societies (Bagaric et al., 2020).
   Eating disorders are an obsession with food or body image that leads to unhealthy
eating habits. Severe cases of eating disorders can cause serious health problems
including brain damage or even death. A recent report (Deloitte Access Economic,
2020) shows that worldwide, over fifty million teens across the world have an eating
disorder, with five and a half million in the U.S., three million from the U.K., and
over 900,000 from Australia. Research found that eating disorders may be caused
by factors that are biological, psychological, or social.
   Biological causes include the amount of physical activity that an individual
engages in, and the metabolic rate of an individual. Some people tend to burn fat
faster than others due to genetic factors. It also includes health conditions such as
13.2 Adolescent Mental Health and EI                                                297

insulin resistance and diabetic conditions. Psychological factors include body image
dissatisfaction, personality traits (e.g., someone who desires perfection), behavioural
inflexibility, and mental conditions such as anxiety disorder. Social factors include
being victims of bullying and teasing, cultural expectation of how a person should
look (e.g., in Asian culture, girls are expected to be slim), the desire to be popular
and admired, loneliness, and lack of social support, thus turning to food for security
and relief of stress (Isomaa et al., 2009).
    The more common types of eating disorders include:
   Anorexia nervosa: People with this disorder have an intense fear of gaining
   weight even when they are actually underweight. They have a dislike for food and
   are generally unhealthily thin. This condition can lead to severe health conditions,
   which may sometimes be fatal.
   Bulimia nervosa: People with this condition also fear weight gain but will eat
   at meal times, sometimes in large amounts, then make themselves vomit. This is
   also harmful to their health in the long run.
   Binge eating disorders: People who binge eat uncontrollably turn to food for
   comfort to help them cope momentarily when they are confronted with disap-
   pointment or upsetting events. As a result, many may become overweight and
   develop other harmful health conditions (Kotler et al., 2001).
It is important that young people develop a positive self-image through being self-
aware. Self-awareness is a key component of emotional intelligence. Adolescents
with strong self-awareness know who they are, why they react to situations the way
they do, and have a stronger sense of direction and life purpose. It helps them to
understand things from multiple perspectives and free them from assumptions and
biases. Emotional competence such as self-awareness will help young people to be
more confident, make better decisions, and to have the power to cope with challenges.



13.2.2 Digital Addiction

The fast-paced progression of online digital technology has gifted us with bound-
less opportunities to learn, to connect with others, to create and innovate. Digital
technology has advanced us with greater ease of doing business, buying and selling
online, doing our banking and accounting, and even teaching and learning from home.
Online games as a form of digital entertainment have given us over thirty years of
enjoyment in different modes. Their attractiveness and variety thrilled us to no limits.
Children and adults enjoy using digital technology to communicate with others and
to keep themselves occupied and entertained in one way or another. Increasingly,
teenagers are gaining limitless access to digital technology with the introduction of
multifunctional portable devices. Many also use them for school learning. A 2017
OECD report informs us that nine out of ten young teens in OECD countries have
access to a smartphone, a tablet, or a laptop.
298                                          13 Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent …

    The report also found that eighty-four per cent of OECD students engage in
social media to connect with their friends with seventy-three per cent using mainly
Facebook and sixty-two per cent engaging in other social media platforms, including
online chats on a daily basis. Seventy-two percent of these students reported that they
feel ‘pressured’ to check their digital device constantly to connect with their friends.
Woods and Scott (2016) cautioned that this sort of ‘emotional investment’ may lead to
emotional stress, higher levels of anxiety, and sometimes affect the sleeping patterns
of young people.
    Digital games are fun and engaging and have been found to benefit young people
in increasing their imagination, and helping them to expand their vocabulary and
general knowledge; some games are designed to help young people to learn about
the environment, history, geography, science, and even cookery and fashion design.
They help them to set goals and develop persistence to reach these step-by-step goals,
building their thinking and strategic skills in a progressive manner (OECD, 2018).
Many also develop a range of computer skills and become technologically savvy. This
may be helpful for their future career choices, such as becoming digital artists, game
designers, software developers, or hardware engineers. Students who are shy and
introverted can join in multi-player online games and play collaboratively with others
to achieve game goals. A U.K. study found that young people who engaged in digital
games for around two hours during weekdays and four hours during weekends have
experienced little negative effect on their learning and emotional health (Przybylski &
Bowes, 2017).
    Unfortunately, digital game addiction has become a problem for teens around the
world leading to mental and physical health issues. Research found that young people
with little parental guidance, and those with an insecure attachment to their parents
are more prone to digital game addiction. Many spend hours online to escape reality
and avoid facing unpleasant experiences associated with family conflict, relational
complications, academic challenges, and personal problems. Excessive screen time
engagement is not only harmful to one’s vision, but it can also cause chronic neck and
back problems, insomnia and loss of appetite. Game addiction is especially severe in
Asia because many Asian children are not as athletic as their counterparts in western
culture, and few value team sports and outdoor physical activities. This will also
compromise their immune system (OECD, 2012).
    Studies have also produced evidence that digital addiction in young people leads
to many social problems and mental health issues, such as cyberbullying, self-image
issues leading to eating disorders, excessive aggression due to a lack of coping skills
and social skills, anxiety disorders and depression (Pew Research Center, 2018;
Przybylski & Bowes, 2017).
    In fulfilling their social and community responsibilities, tech giants such as Face-
book, Microsoft and Nintendo have online support services to help children and
teens with their digital addiction problems. For example, Facebook has a Bullying
Prevention Hub to help young people learn about bullying and how to seek help,
while Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo provide online guides and videos for adults to
teach them how to set time limit and content restrictions on their game systems to
protect children. Unfortunately, not too many parents and teachers are aware of these
13.2 Adolescent Mental Health and EI                                                 299

platforms, and not much is known about the effectiveness of these support programs
(Woods & Scott, 2016; Yager et al., 2013).
   Despite the accumulating demands on school leaders and school teachers, sugges-
tions have been made for schools to do more to help prevent and reduce digital game
addiction and over-usage of digital devices. One way of doing so is to equip teachers
with skills and knowledge in digital literacy and learn how to empower children to
exercise self-control and self-regulation in their usage of digital technology (OECD,
2014; Poli, 2017; Vannucci et al., 2017). Some helpful suggestions and strategies for
parents, teachers and young people can be found in the Resource section at the end
of this chapter.



13.2.3 School Bullying

A 2018 OECD report on school life for students has revealed that twenty-three per
cent of the students across all OECD reported being bullied at least a few times a
month. Students who reported being frequently exposed to bullying also reported
feeling a range of negative emotions including fear, sadness, and depression. Boys
who are low-achieving students appeared more likely to be bullied than those with
higher academic achievement. It was also noted that a higher rate of bullying occurred
in schools where the school climate did not support a sense of belonging in all
students. In an earlier report, Cross et al. (2009) found bullying was more common
in Year 5 and Year 8. Surprisingly, eighty-seven per cent of the students in this study
reported that they had witnessed bullying interactions and did nothing to help, most
of them claiming they did not know what to do, or felt that it was nothing unusual
worth reporting.
   Research shows that young people bully for a variety of reasons. Some of the
reasons for bullying identified in the literature (Doehne et al., 2018; Earnshaw et al.,
2018; Plamondon et al., 2021; Shetgiri, 2013; Tippett & Wolke, 2014) include:
•   A desire for power
•   A desire for popularity
•   Peer pressure
•   Problems at home
•   Prejudice
•   Bullying just for fun
It is well documented that victims of bullying suffer negative consequences, from
being anxious and fearful, to adopting maladaptive coping strategies, or even
becoming bullies themselves at a later stage. It is also found that most bullying victims
are nervous, shy, vulnerable, and have low resilience attributes. Other studies suggest
that bullying victims are often lonely, have difficulty making friends, and are more
likely to be avoided by their peers (Kochel et al., 2015; Nansel et al., 2004). Bullying
victims reported more intense emotional problems such as anxiety and depression
300                                         13 Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent …

than other students. There is also a likelihood that they are more at risk in devel-
oping emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse, anti-social
personality disorders, and even psychosis (Stein et al., 2007). Evidence was given
in an Australian adolescents report that bullying victims had the highest rates of
self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide (Ford et al., 2017). Alarmingly,
some bullying victims have admitted to thoughts of taking a gun or a weapon to
school to protect themselves, or even to using it to commit major acts of violence
against the bullies and other students who remained silent bystanders (Glew et al.,
2008; Unnever, 2005).
   Currently, many schools worldwide engage in a whole-school approach to address
the problem of bullying using preventive strategies, effective pedagogy, and devel-
oping strong school-parent partnerships. In addition, school leaders and educa-
tors now understand that helping students to develop a higher level of emotional
intelligence and preparing them with skills to manage their emotions and devel-
oping resilience and problem-solving skills are more effective and would yield more
positive results.



13.2.4 Substance Abuse

Substance abuse refers to the excessive consumption of alcohol and other drugs
(legal or illegal) to cope with emotional unrest or painful experiences. Some people
are also addicted to inhaling petrol or glue to gain a heightened stimulation in their
brains. The use of highly addictive drugs (including alcohol) can lead to increased
dependence and craving. An addicted person will experience withdrawal symptoms
which are very uncomfortable and debilitating (Johnson et al., 2014).
   Many young people use drugs or consume alcohol out of curiosity, or to feel
‘grown up’ and be part of a group. Some may do so to ‘relax’ or have fun, to escape
boredom and loneliness, or to distract themselves from mental or physical pain or
challenges. Medical reports have found that substance abuse in teens will affect their
brain growth and physical development. Many have problems with sleeping, poor
appetite, and some may even have high blood pressure or heart conditions. They are
more likely to engage in risky behaviour such as fighting, dangerous driving, or even
criminal activities to get money to buy drugs (Kann et al., 2014).
   Currently, there are educational programs embedded in the school curriculum,
such as drug education and family life education. In addition to these programs,
the teaching of social emotional learning will also help students to understand their
problems, learn skills and competence to self-regulate, problem solve, and make
better choices.
13.2 Adolescent Mental Health and EI                                               301

13.2.5 Teen Depression and Suicidal Thoughts

Teen suicide is also a prevailing mental health-related problem in many countries. One
study claimed that there are eleven youth suicides every day in the U.S. (Drapeau &
McIntosh, 2015). Globally, according to the World Health Organization, suicide was
the second leading cause of death among fifteen- to twenty-nine-year-olds in 2016.
That year, about 60,000 boys and girls between the ages of ten and nineteen died by
suicide. The suicide rate was highest in India and Bangladesh amongst young people
who struggled in poverty. Other young people, such as those in Japan and South
Korea, committed suicide due to academic pressure and poor family relationships
(WHO, 2016).
    Major risk factors identified include mental health issues, poor family relation-
ships and weak parental support, loneliness and absence of friendship and peer
support, alcohol and drug use, and being bullied or abused physically, sexually or
psychologically. It was also found that ninety-per cent of the young people who
committed suicide had mental health issues, and over fifty per cent of them suffered
from depression (Holt et al., 2015; McKinnon et al., 2016).
    Depression, also known as major depressive disorder or clinical depression, is a
mood disorder that causes persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness. In chil-
dren and adolescents, symptoms can include irritability, excessive worries, physical
aches and pains, moodiness, anger, low sense of self-worth, poor attention, lack of
interest in everything, extreme sensitivity and reactivity. They may even have eating
disorders and sleeping problems. It could be linked to the change of brain chem-
istry, or hormonal imbalance, or it could be associated with personality traits. Some
people are more sensitive than others and tend to repress their feelings (American
Psychiatric Association, 2017).
    Some scholars found that suicidal behaviour tend to be associated with young
people who are aggressive and impulsive, and deficient in coping and problem-
solving skills (Smischney et al., 2014). Adolescents with low socioeconomic status
who live with a single parent are also prone to engage in suicidal thoughts.
    Since the turn of the century, schools worldwide have put in place policies to
identify at-risk students and help them with guidance and referrals to other trained
professionals, such as child psychologists and counsellors. More and more schools
have put in place suicide prevention programs to heighten the awareness of teachers
and parents in observing suicidal symptoms, and educational programs to develop
necessary knowledge and skills to address mental health problems (Erbacher et al.,
2015; Huberty, 2006). These programs include skills in developing self-awareness,
stress management, coping and resilience skills, problem solving, and communica-
tion skills. Some components of these programs also incorporate helping students to
be aware of their thoughts and identify signs of behaviour associated with suicidal
risks, and also to be aware of these signs in their friends. Other schools have student
assistant programs guided by policies and a student suicide safety plan. Some part-
nered with mental health services in the community and offer individual counselling,
302                                         13 Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent …

and group counselling sessions for identified at-risk students (Zenere & Lazarus,
2009).
   Studies have also found that school-based suicide prevention programs are effec-
tive in heightening students’ awareness, increasing their knowledge, and helping
them to develop a more positive attitude towards suicide prevention. What they
found to be most helpful was that from these programs, more students have learnt
to develop help-seeking skills and problem-solving skills with their social relation-
ships (Calear et al., 2014; Cusimano & Sameem, 2011). Other researchers have
also reported that students who received instructional intervention on mental health
issues presented more sensitivity and empathy towards their peer who showed at risk
behaviour (Naylor et al., 2009).
   On the other hand, some studies have reported that not all of these school-based
programs were effective. Miller et al. (2009) looked at thirteen programs and found
that only two of them offered strong evidence to show a reduction in suicide attempts
or improved knowledge and attitudes towards depression and suicide. This suggests
that school leaders and teachers must understand the seriousness of youth suicidal
thoughts and be given adequate learning and development to effectively help their
students. Cigularov et al. (2008) detected two major barriers to effectively identify
students who are at risk of suicide. They found that many with suicidal thoughts
and tendencies are reluctant to get help, because some fear being stigmatised, some
cannot find a trusted adult to talk to, some have had similar experiences and did not
find the intervention helpful, and some just do not want to talk about it. Another
barrier is associated with the peers of the at-risk students. Some of them seemed
to be overprotective and did not want their friend to be ‘in trouble’, or they have
promised them to keep their secrets about suicidal thoughts, or they just do not have
the maturity and skills to know what to do.
   Teen suicide is a very complex challenge, but it is preventable. School leaders
and teachers need to be equipped with more knowledge and skills to understand the
complexity of this issue. By forming partnerships with mental health agencies and
organisations, a school can gain more resources and learn more strategies. Helping
students to develop their social-emotional intelligence is one beneficial approach.



13.2.6 The School’s Role in Promoting Positive
       Mental Health

School in the twenty-first century is no longer an institution that imparts knowledge
with books and information delivery. This antiquated school-factory model is now
replaced by a dynamic and evolving one that changes with time and societal demands.
The learning environment is no longer confined to the classroom but extends into the
home and the community. Students are not just consumers of curriculum plans but
are active creators of knowledge and capacity building. They are no longer taught
13.2 Adolescent Mental Health and EI                                                  303

but are inspired and nurtured to take charge of their own learning and develop their
individual potential and talents.
    Being a teacher is a multifaceted profession. Teaching is an art as well as a science.
It involves knowledge and skills in pedagogies as well as the development of rela-
tionship capability. Young teachers in this generation are coached and inspired to
adapt and adopt new practices to manifest the essence of the education philosophy
of whole-child development by being caring, knowledgeable, responsible, and able
to lead change. However, teachers are not super beings. The demands on them are
too intense. It is therefore vital that they learn to work collaboratively and share
their talents and diverse strengths to meet the different challenges placed upon them.
Teachers choose their profession because they are passionate about making a differ-
ence in young peoples’ lives. When they partner with other members of the school
community, they will ease their burden and find more satisfaction in their vocation.



13.3 EI Models Used in Education

Emotional intelligence is generally understood to be an individual’s capability to
perceive, understand and manage one’s own emotions, to use emotional information
to guide thinking and behaviour, to show empathy towards others and use effective
social and people skills to build relationships with others, and to enhance positive
and helpful interpersonal relationships. The three most common models in EI are:
The Ability Model (AEI), The Trait Model (TEI), and the Mixed Model, which is a
combination of the two previous models with a focus on social emotional intelligence
(SEI).



13.3.1 Ability Emotional Intelligence (AEI)

Ability Emotional Intelligence (AEI) is defined as “one’s capacity to process
emotional information accurately and efficiently, including information that is rele-
vant to the recognition, construction, and regulation of emotion in oneself and others”
(Mayer & Salovey, 1995, p. 197). This capacity embraces the ability to truthfully
perceive emotions in oneself and to manage one’s emotions, to use emotions to facil-
itate thinking, to understand the emotions of others, to understand emotional signals
sent through non-verbal cues, and to have the ability to manage emotions in order to
attain goals (Mayer & Salovey, 1997).
    Following the introduction of Howard Gardner’s concept of Multiple Intelligences
in 1983, growing attention was focused on exploring other aspects of human intelli-
gence pertaining to relevant information about the construct of general intelligence.
Mayer et al. (2000) acknowledge the notion that the construct of AEI embraces
intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences and other aspects of the multiple intel-
ligences described by Gardner, and should be regarded as a domain of intelligence.
304                                           13 Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent …

Likewise, Mayer and his colleagues (2008) have produced empirical evidence to
substantiate that AEI plays an important role in understanding a diverse domain of
human abilities. John Carroll (1993) points out that AEI incorporates the inclusion
of other intelligences, combining perceptual organisation, visualisation, and verbal
comprehension. He further explains that intelligence develops with age and expe-
rience, reflects mental performance rather than behavioural attributes, and can be
described as a set of related abilities. This means students can develop and increase
their AEI through school education and other experience-learning opportunities in
extracurricular activities.
   There is a range of tools developed by researchers who investigated the develop-
ment of EI in school children and adolescents. Amongst them, two commonly used
assessment tools include:
1.    The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT-YRV)
      (2002)
          This assessment tool is designed to assess the EI of young people aged
      between ten and eighteen. It measures how they perceive emotions, facili-
      tate thoughts with emotions, and understand and manage them. It includes
      their capacity to associate reasons with feelings, and their capacity to enhance
      thoughts with emotions. It also measures how well these young individuals can
      perform tasks and solve emotional problems.
2.    The Emotional Intelligence Scale for Children (EISC) (Sullivan, 1999)
          This assesses the ability of children to identify, understand, control, and use
      emotions. The assessments are carried out through different activities, such
      as perceiving emotions through interpreting facial expressions, musical activi-
      ties and stories, understanding emotions through brief vignettes, and managing
      emotions through interactive stories.
There are both strengths and limitations in these measurement instruments, and critics
have pointed out the pros and cons of using these and other similar assessment
tools. However, they provide educators, psychologists and professionals working
with children the basic information on the strengths and development needs of the
children they work with.
   Through using these tools and employing other quantitative and qualitative
studies, a volume of data has substantiated that young people with high AEI tend to
gain positive outcome from various aspects of life. For example, Fine et al. (2003)
found that AEI positively correlates with good social relations in school children and
negatively correlates with social deviance. Similarly, Brackett et al. (2006) found
correlated aspects of AEI in how young people relate with their family and the
understanding of self and others in relationships. They also confirmed that young
adults with higher AEI show greater self-perception, social competence and less use
of negative interpersonal behaviour. They are more empathic, more pleasant to be
around, and more socially skilful than those with lower AEI. The studies of Barchard
(2003) and Brackett and Mayer (2003) also found that AEI correlated with higher
academic achievement and intellectual problem solving. AEI has also been found
to positively correlate with healthy adolescent mental health (Davis & Humphrey,
13.3 EI Models Used in Education                                                    305

2012). Furthermore, Sanchez-Ruiz et al. (2013) suggest that measurements of AEI
predict academic achievement above IQ and personality traits.
   However, Steinberg (2005) opines that understanding the relationship between
AEI and academic achievement involves an understanding of the biopsychoso-
cial developmental changes in adolescence, including their cognitive development,
emotional and social development. It is a complex process. He points out that the
adolescent emotional changes occur at the onset of puberty, leading to an increase
in emotional sensitivity, stress, and a heightened sense of novelty and rewards. In
contrast, changes in their cognitive-control system is slower to mature and will keep
developing until they reach young adulthood, around the age of twenty-five. This will
affect their ability for self-regulation and impulse control, and some executive func-
tions, such as decision making. Other experts in the field advocate for more research
studies on AEI to maintain practitioner enthusiasm to learn more about how children
acquire AEI and the developmental process of AEI in different age groups spanning
childhood to adulthood (Agnolie et al., 2012; Billlings et al., 2014, Humphrey et al.,
2007).
   In summary, research on AEI in the last two decades has substantiated that AEI
plays a critical role in achieving desired objectives in various aspects of the lives of
young people -personal, family, academic, and work performance. This demonstrates
the significance of EI abilities in facilitating life success and relationship building.



13.3.2 Traits Emotional Intelligence (TEI)

While AEI recognises an individual’s cognitive-emotional ability, Traits Emotional
Intelligence (TEI) acknowledges the behavioural dispositions relating to perception,
procession and how one uses emotional information. It describes one’s emotional
self-efficacy (Petrides, 2011). The TEI model distinguishes the non-cognitive facets
related to personality traits. They include:
• Adaptability: flexibility and willingness to adapt to new environments and
  conditions
• Assertiveness: forthrightness and willingness to stand up for one’s rights.
• Emotion expression: the ability to communicate one’s feelings to others.
• Emotion management (self and others): the ability to control one’s emotions and
  to influence others’ feelings.
• Emotion perception (self and others): to be clear about one’s own emotions and
  other people’s feelings.
• Emotion regulation: the ability to control one’s own emotions.
• Impulsiveness: to be reflective and less likely to give in to one’s urges.
• Relationship management: capability of maintaining fulfilling personal relation-
  ships.
• Self-esteem: self-confidence and positive self-worth.
• Self-motivation: unlikeliness to give up when facing adversity.
306                                          13 Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent …

• Social awareness: to have adequate social skills and be able to connect with social
  networks.
• Stress management: to be capable of withstanding pressure and regulating stress.
• Trait empathy: to be able to understand someone else’s perspective.
• Trait happiness: usually cheerful and satisfied with one’s life.
• Trait optimism: usually confident and likely to look on the bright side of life.
Examples of assessment tools commonly used to measure TEI in children and
adolescents include:
1.    The Schutte Self-Report Measure of Emotional Intelligence (SSREI)
      (Schutte et al, 1998)
      This is a thirty-item self-report which comprises four sub-scales measuring
      emotion perception, utilising emotions, managing self-relevant emotions, and
      managing others’ emotions. Participants responds to items using a seven-point
      Likert scale ranging from one (completely disagree or strongly disagree) to seven
      (completely agree or strongly agree). One study by Ciarrochi et al. (2001) found
      this tool useful in measuring adolescents’ self-esteem and trait anxiety.
2.    Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEIQue-AF) (Petrides & Furnham, 2001)
      This is a 150-item questionnaire, and a shorter version with 33 items, which
      identify the following dispositions:
      • Well-being: self-esteem; happiness; optimism
      • Self-control: emotion regulation; low impulsiveness; stress management
      • Emotionality: empathy; emotion perception; emotion expression; relation-
        ship skills
      • Sociability: emotion management; assertiveness; social awareness/social
        competence
      • Auxiliary facets: adaptability; self-motivation
3.    The Swinburn University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT-EY) (Billings
      et al., 2014)
      This is a 68-item questionnaire designed to assess a four-factor model of EI
      in pre-adolescents. The first part of the test contains 38 self-report items to
      measure perception and appraisal of emotion, emotional facilitation of thinking,
      and reflective regulation of emotion. The next eight items measure the partic-
      ipant’s ability to identify emotions in others, while the remaining twenty-two
      items measure understanding and emotion analysis, using performance-based
      assessment methods.
No measurement tool is perfect. Despite criticism from other researchers, these tests
give useful information to teachers and professionals working with children and
youths, and are also good tools to help young people gain increased self-awareness
and to reflect on how these trait qualities impact them in helpful and unhelpful ways.
13.3 EI Models Used in Education                                                       307

13.3.3 Social Emotional Intelligence (SEI)

Social Emotional Intelligence (SEI) refers to the ability to be aware of one’s own
emotions, to have self-control and be able to manage one’s emotions, to be socially
aware, including understanding others’ emotions, and knowing how to build and
maintain social relationships. In the school setting, this involves a repertoire of self-
understanding, social understanding, and social skills.
   In the past two decades, increased attention has been devoted to help school chil-
dren to develop SEI and social-emotional competencies. Globally, educators and
teachers became interested in learning about the importance of SEI and developing
knowledge and skills to incorporate Social Emotional Learning (SEL) in the school
curriculum. According to Lickona (1991), SEL stems from traditional moral educa-
tion, an integral component in education over the past 200 years with the aim to
“help young people to be smart, and help them to be good” (p. 6). In the 1990s, there
was a refocus to help young people to develop an ‘ethical character’, thus, ‘character
education’ has become the buzz word. This component of school education focuses
on the building of six teachable ‘pillars of character’: respect, responsibility, fairness,
trustworthiness, caring, and citizenship (Lapsley & Narvaez, 2006).
   In 1994, a group of educators, researchers, psychologists, child-welfare practi-
tioners and child advocates came together in a U.S. conference to discuss the ‘missing
pieces’ in education. They formed an organisation known as CASEL: Collaborative
for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning. Their goal was to establish high-
quality, evidence-based learning and development of SEI in school education. In
1997, members of CASEL collaborated and contributed their respective knowledge,
insights and expertise and produced a book entitled Promoting Social and Emotional
Learning: Guidelines for Educators (Elias et al., 1997). This book instigated a wave
of research on the effectiveness of SEL for supporting students’ social and academic
success. Positive results produced by these studies led to a surge of demands from
teachers, school leaders, educational policy makers, parents and students themselves,
to learn more about SEI and SEL, locally (in the US) and globally. Today, SEL is
becoming an integral part of school education worldwide.
   Social-emotional learning (SEL) is seen as a preventative approach to help
students develop higher social-emotional intelligence and social-emotional compe-
tence. Internationally, schools are incorporating SEL with a multitude of approaches.
Some programs are embedded into the academic curricula, such as Language Arts
and Personal Development subjects. Some approaches include co-operative learning
and collaborative learning, where students are encouraged to work in small groups to
achieve a common goal. Some schools plan programs to engage students in service
learning, to plan projects to help members of the school community achieve specific
goals, some lead students in friendship and bonding camps, and some schools hold
regular ‘conversation circles’ to listen to students’ challenges, and help students find
solutions through student leadership training, buddy systems and peer mentoring
(Brock et al., 2008; Fredericks, 2003; Ginsburg-Block et al., 2006).

    Through SEL, students demonstrated increased levels of self-awareness, leading
to stronger ability in self-management and making responsible decisions. Many
have developed stronger self-efficacy leading to increased school engagement and
academic achievement. Students who are strong in self-confidence and self-efficacy
experienced less bullying victimisation, less loneliness, and an increased sense of
optimism and happiness (Cheng & Furnham, 2002; Kokkinos & Kipritsi, 2012).
Other studies also produced evidence that through SEL, students increased their
self-awareness and self-efficacy, resulting in fewer behavioural problems at school,
less substance abuse, fewer suicide attempts and less crime involvement (Griffin
et al., 2015; Jones et al, 2015; Tangney et al., 2004; Wulfert et al., 2002).
    An increase in relationship skills is also noted with effective SEL programs in
school education. Studies found a decrease in bullying behaviour and instances
of school bullying, including cyberbullying, when schools focused attention on
addressing these problems by helping students to develop and strengthen their social-
emotional competencies. It was also found that students with stronger relationship
skills are more popular, have more friends, show more confidence and ability to
solve relationship problems, and have fewer depressive symptoms than those with
poor SEI (Adams & Bukowski, 2007; Boulton et al., 1999; Dalley et al., 1994; Kwon
et al., 2012).
    In 2011, Durlak and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis and studied 213
universal SEL programs. They found that students who participated in school-based
SEL programs showed improvement in their social-emotional skills, more positive
attitudes and social behaviour, were more able to cope with academic demands, and
showed improved academic performance. They found that these programs are more
effective when they are carried out or taught frequently throughout the school year.
In addition, teachers who are specifically trained in SEI and SEL had more positive
student outcomes compared with those who did not receive SEI training. This was
also noted by other researchers who indicated that teacher preparation is essential
to help school children develop SEI and social-emotional competence (Aber et al.,
2003; Reyes et al., 2012).



13.4 EI and Resilience Competency

Resilience is the ability to recover from setbacks, disappointment, challenges, and
adversity. Children and teens with high levels of EI are better able to control and
regulate their emotions and are better able to cope with challenges and misfortune
with higher resilience. It was also noted that adolescents with a stronger sense of
self-identity and have better coping skills are stronger with their interpersonal and
social skills, and are generally happier and healthier (Cahill et al., 2015).

13.4.1 Factors That Affect Mental Health in Children
       and Adolescents

There are numerous factors in life that can have an impact on our mental health.
These can be risk factors or protective factors. Risk factors can include:
• poor parenting and dysfunctional family relationships.
• socio-demographic influences: young people from a low socio-economic back-
  ground are more vulnerable and tend to suffer setbacks and pressures that lead to
  mental health issues.
• lack of community support: adolescents who do not know where to access support
  usually fall victim to unhelpful peer pressure and engage in negative and even
  criminal conduct.
• Lack of motivation and direction: teens without necessary adult support feel lost
  and hopeless. They have poor self-esteem and are often lonely and unmotivated,
  resulting in low achievement at school.
On the other hand, young people who are well supported by their family and parents
are more confident, feel loved and valued; they are curious, enjoy learning, have
better friendship skills and a positive attitude. Dray et al. (2017) suggest that there
are internal and external protective factors that enhance resilience in young people.

Internal protective factors include:
•   cognitive competence
•   ability to cooperate
•   communication skills
•   moral competence
•   a sense of empowerment
•   goals and aspirations
•   emotional competence: self-awareness, self-control, self-regulation, self-efficacy
•   social and emotional competence: awareness of others, empathy
•   social and emotional skills
External protective factors include:
•   family and parental support
•   adult expectations
•   community caring relationships
•   community meaningful participation
•   community support
•   home caring relationships
•   pro-social peers
•   school support
•   school caring relationships
•   school meaningful participation

Beyond Blues is an Australian organisation that supports and promotes mental health
for adults and children. It listed four major factors that influence the development of
resilience:
1.    Factors within the child: including genetic and biological factors, self-esteem,
      self-compassion, autonomy and independence, ability to identify and under-
      stand one’s emotions, social skills and empathy, optimism and positive attitudes,
      sense of responsibility, connection with the family and community, and healthy
      thought habits.
2.    Family factors: include positive family relationships, family identity and
      connectedness, and effective parenting.
3.    Community and Societal factors: include peer connection and interaction,
      education setting providing positive support, social inclusivity, family and
      child friend community, community values and belief, socially inclusive and
      family/child-friendly public policies.
4.    Factors within family, community and society: include opportunities for
      healthy risk taking, opportunities for positive experiences, ongoing, meaningful
      relationships with family and community members, supportive networks.


13.4.2 EI and Resilience Competencies That Support Good
       Mental Health

Studies incorporating empirical data verify that resilience competencies include self-
efficacy, empathy, compassion, self-reflection, self-identity, problem solving and
decision-making skills, coping, and knowing how to seek help.
• Self-efficacy: this refers to the ability to believe in one’s capabilities, maintain
  and apply skills to accomplish tasks and achieve goals, and have the needed confi-
  dence and skills to complete what one sets out to do (Bandura, 1994; Baumeister
  et al., 2003). It requires a growth mindset and a range of coping strategies to
  face challenges and setbacks (Dweck, 2000). Bandura (1994) maintained that
  self-efficacy can be learned through observing role models, from past experi-
  ence of success, and from support and encouragement from family and school.
  Zimmerman & Schunk (2008) found that when children are provided with posi-
  tive feedback, they are more likely to sustain the belief that they can achieve tasks
  and goals without self-doubt. However, Shean et al. (2014) warned that parents
  and other adults who are over-protective may impede the development of a child’s
  self-efficacy.
• Empathy: Grotberg (1995) believes that empathy is an important predictor of
  resilience. McGrath and Noble (2011) claim that empathy is a pro-social trait
  found in children who are loved. They found that young people with empathy
  show kindness and support to peers and are less judgemental and more accepting
  of others. Conversely, those with low levels of empathy are likely to engage in
  antisocial behaviour.
13.4 EI and Resilience Competency                                                  311

• Compassion is the ability to feel concern for the suffering or misfortune of others.
  It also embraces the act of altruism, a behaviour that is intrinsically motivated
  to benefit others without self-interest. Lozada et al. (2016) claimed that people
  experience a natural sense of happiness when they are engaging in altruistic acts.
  Children learn to be compassionate and altruistic through observing others, and
  also through mindfulness training. In an investigation with a group of students
  in a public school, Lozada et al. (2016) found that, in a period of 10 weeks,
  participants of the program showed increased cooperation and increased self- and
  other-awareness.
• Self-reflection is the ability to observe and evaluate our own cognitive, emotional
  and behavioural processes. It is a basic skill that empowers an individual to
  think about past choices, and conduct risk analysis for future plans and deci-
  sions. Self-reflection can enhance personal coping strategies and build resilience.
  When young people are challenged with conflict or confronted with situations
  of uncertainty, they can learn to use self-reflection to work through information,
  from known to unknown. They can learn to think through ‘what if’ scenarios and
  consider alternatives for achieving goals or solving problems. Grotberg (1995)
  found that children with self-reflection skills are able to modify or regulate their
  behaviour. Reflective skills can also strengthen resilience.
• Self-identity involves being true to oneself and having clarity about one’s personal
  values and beliefs. It is acquired through experience and accumulated knowl-
  edge in our stages of childhood to adulthood development (Erikson, 1968).
  Young people with a strong sense of self-identity are confident and have a strong
  sense of self-efficacy. Young people who are confronted with traumatic family
  or personal life disruptions (e.g., loss of parents, parental divorce, ill-treatment
  from adults such as excessive criticism, child abuse) usually have an unstable
  self-identity. They generally have low self-esteem and view themselves as inade-
  quate, unworthy, and have a chronic feeling of emptiness. They have no sense of
  self-direction resulting in the inability to set goals, low motivation to achieve, an
  absence of aspiration, and choose to dissociate when under stress (Aldridge et al.,
  2016; Nicoll, 2014).
• Problem solving requires critical thinking and sound decision making skills.
  We learn to solve problems by watching others and also from our past experi-
  ence. It also requires cognitive skills such as perception to understand cause and
  effect, pros and cons, and the ability to define the problem. It also requires good
  communication skills to listen to others to understand the underlying causes of
  problems and knowing what alternatives are available. Creativity and flexibility
  in thinking are also contributing factors. Young children learn to solve prob-
  lems through playing with blocks or educational toys. At school, they learn to
  discuss with others, to develop analytical and deductive skills. They expand their
  thinking through reading and acquiring general knowledge about their social envi-
  ronment and the world. Apart from these skills, young people need to develop
  self-regulation to control impulsivity and not to react with unhelpful behaviour.
  Parental input and school education play a strong role in helping young people to
  develop problem solving and decision skills. Teens with mental health issues are
312                                          13 Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent …

  often weak in identifying their problems, let alone having the skills to solve them.
  On the other hand, young people who are strong in problem solving are resilient
  and have higher levels of EI.
• Coping and knowing how to seek help. Children and teens experience a vast
  array of emotions. In the process of growing up, they need to learn to cope
  with boredom, disappointment, embarrassment, fear, and anxiety. Sometimes they
  learn through trial and error, and perhaps painful experience and a few tears to
  deal with these ‘not nice feelings’. Psychologists and practitioners working with
  young people talk about two types of coping skills: emotion-focused coping skills
  and problem-focused coping skills. Emotion-focused coping skills are necessary
  when the situation cannot be changed, or a problem has no solution. Young people
  must learn how to accept reality, tolerate stress, and gain perseverance to deal with
  unpleasant emotions associated with the matter. Problem-focused coping skills
  involve examining the problems and analysing the situation to find a way to solve
  the issue, and to decide what actions to take to change the undesired situation. This
  is a developmental and learning process that takes place at home, in social situa-
  tions, and at school. Many young people develop mental health issues because they
  have no one to help them with those matters that are bothering or hurting them. It
  is vital that young people are taught to seek help from adults by talking to them, or
  by seeking professional help when they have upsetting problems. Knowing how
  to seek help is a necessary skill in developing resilience competence (Ben-Zur,
  2009; Brannon & Feist, 2009; Folkman & Lazarus, 1988).


13.5 The School’s Role in Supporting Students’ EI
     Development

Changes brought by transition phases may cause stress and uncertainty. Young
people need to draw on resilience skills and support resources from home and
school. Research evidence shows that school plays a significant role in improving the
mental wellbeing of children and adolescents through the SEL program and a strong
focus in helping students to develop resilience skills. Programs that are aligned with
curriculum goals and implemented on a continual and long-term basis have been
found to be effective in raising academic standards, improving cognitive ability, and
reducing behavioural problems (e.g., Barret & Pahl, 2006; Greenberg, 2010; Nelson
et al., 2003; Nicoll, 2014; Ruttledge et al., 2016; Slee et al., 2009).
    Teachers devoted to supporting their students’ emotional growth are skilled in not
only developing their SEL through teaching, but also encourage and instil the ability
of self-empowerment. This means students are nurtured to make conscious decisions
to make positive choices, to plan and take action to accomplish goals, to understand
their strengths and required strengths to be motivated to learn and achieve success.
Schools that are successful in implementing EI components in their educational
programs also foster the understanding that an attitude of optimism is essential when
dealing with difficult situations. They also encourage friendliness and care for others,
13.5 The School’s Role in Supporting Students’ EI Development                       313

to be adaptive to change, and develop useful help-seeking behaviour when they need
it. These SEI and resilience skills are beneficial in promoting personal and peer
wellbeing (Cahill et al., 2015; Grotberg, 1997; Seidenfeld et al., 2014; Shean et al.,
2014).
    There are many different models for raising the EI and resilience competence of
school children and teens. Here are examples of a few commonly used ones in school
education. They are The Bounce Back program, The Grotberg’s Resilience Project,
and The Resilience Doughnut.
    The Bounce Back Program (McGrath & Noble, 2003)
    Bounce Back teaches the core skills advocated by CASEL. It is a whole-school
approach incorporating evidence-informed coping skills and activities based on effec-
tive teaching strategies, psychological theories and cognitive behaviour therapy. It
provides a wide range of practical strategies and resources for teaching primary
school students how to cope with the challenges and difficulties they face in their
everyday lives, and to learn how to ‘bounce back’ when they experience sadness,
disappointment and uncertainty, frustration, and challenging times. It provides strate-
gies and teaching materials for primary schools at three levels, from kindergarten
to Year 2, Years 3–4, and Years 5–6 with age-appropriate children’s literature and
reading material, interactive activities to foster cooperative learning, and teacher
resource books. The organisation of the units is sequential and is helpful for teachers,
especially those who have not undergone SEL training. The program features the
following themes:
• Core values: honesty, fairness, acceptance of differences and responsibility.
• Social values: inclusion, kindness, cooperation, friendliness, being respectful to
  others and self-respect.
• Bouncing back skills: skills and attitudes for coping and being resilient.
• Courage: finding courage in both everyday life and difficult circumstances.
• Looking on the bright side: optimistic thinking and positivity skills.
• Emotions: amplifying positive emotions and managing uncomfortable ones.
• Relationships: social skills for making and keeping friends and managing conflict.
• Humour: using humour to connect with others, to cope better and to understand
  differences between helpful and harmful humour.
• Being safe: skills for understanding, countering and managing bullying situations;
  skills for supporting others who are being bullied.
• Success: skills that lead to successful goal achievement (goal setting, growth
  mindset, overcoming obstacles); identifying your own positive character strengths
  and ability strengths.
The Bounce Back program has won many educational awards and has been acknowl-
edged to be highly effective in increasing student’s EI and resilience over many years.
The use of high-quality children’s literature and videos, thinking tools and educa-
tional games, as well as relationship-building strategies of cooperative learning and
circle time, have been found to be highly engaging and effective in enriching students’
understating of their personal development and building effective personal and social
skills (McCrath & Noblem, 2011, 2018).

Grotberg’s Resilience Project (1995)
This program is built on the philosophy that young people can develop resilience
through understanding themselves, their strengths and capabilities, and the resources
available to them so that they know where and how to seek help when necessary. The
project comprises three components: I HAVE, I AM, and I CAN (Grotberg, 1997).
   I HAVE refers to support and resources the individual can access in times of need.
They include:
• People around me I trust and who love me, no matter what—trusting relationships
• People who set limits for me so I know when to stop before there is danger or
  trouble—structure and rules at home
• People who show me how to do things correctly by the way they do things—role
  models
• People who want me to learn to do things on my own—encouragement for
  autonomy
• People who help me when I am sick, in danger, or need to learn—access to health,
  education, welfare, and support services
   I AM. This component helps students to be self-aware of their personal strength
characteristics.
• A person people can like and love—lovable
• Glad to do nice things for others and show my concern—loving, empathic,
  altruistic
• Respectful of myself and others—proud of self
• Willing to be responsible for what I do—autonomous and responsible
• Sure, things will be all right—possessing hope, faith, and trust
   I CAN refers to the individual’s interpersonal and social skills
• Talk to others about things that frighten me or bother me—communicate
• Find ways to solve problems that I face—problem solving
• Control myself when I feel like doing something not right or dangerous—manage
  feelings and impulses
• Figure out when it is a good time to talk to someone or take action—gauge my
  temperament and that of others
• Find someone to help when I need it—seek trusting relationships
Grotberg believes that behaviour is shaped by the interplay of these factors of
resilience: I have, I am and I can. Adults helping children and teens to develop
resilience must understand the process of resilience. This model helps teachers and
other adults working with young people to focus attention on the impact of these
factors. Each student is different and has unique qualities and needs; knowing what
factors of resilience need more attention will be more effective when helping them
develop the needed mindsets and capabilities to cope with challenges and adversity.
13.5 The School’s Role in Supporting Students’ EI Development                      315

The Resilience Doughnut (2018)
The Resilience Doughnut is a model developed by Lyn Worsley (2006) and her
colleagues to help people increase and develop their resilience by recognising their
personal strengths and building on them. Worsley is one of the founders of The
Resilience Centre in Australia. There are two models, one for children and adoles-
cents, which is commonly used in schools, and one for helping adults. The model is
shaped like a doughnut, i.e., a circle with a hole in the middle, very similar to Grot-
berg’s Resilience Project. The core of this model (the hole in the middle) represents
the person’s values and beliefs, including how they view themselves (‘Who I am’),
their awareness of those who support them (‘I have’), and the level of confidence
they have in their own abilities (‘What I can do’). The outer circle of the doughnut
comprises seven sections, each one representing a key factor to build resiliency.
Teachers, school psychologists or social workers need to consider each of these
factors to work out the underlying causes of the child’s problems. These factors are:
• The Parent Factor: characteristics of strong and effective parenting.
• The Skill Factor: evidence of self-competence.
• The Family and Identity Factor: where family identity and connectedness is
  evident.
• The Education Factor: experience of connections and relationships during the
  learning process.
• The Peer Factor: where social and moral development is enhanced through
  interaction with peers.
• The Community Factor: where the morals and values of the local community
  are transferred and the young person is supported.
• The Money Factor: where the young person develops the ability to give as well
  as take from society through employment and purposeful spending.
A scoring system was designed to help individuals to identify their strengths in facing
challenges and adversities. The scoring system identifies the three strongest factors
of the seven listed above, from which the participant can draw on to strengthen
their resilience skills and build on the rest. Teachers and professionals working with
children and adolescents need to undergo training to obtain a licence to use this
model. The model aims to facilitate interventions and programs that help young
people to build resilience, improve their EI, and enhance their mental health.



13.6 Conclusion

Mental health issues are becoming more prevalent globally as the world becomes
more complex and challenging with so many environmental, social and health issues.
An OECD report in 2015 found that one in six people across EU countries had a
mental health problem. Globally, mental health problems represent the largest burden
of disease among young people. Half of all mental illnesses are found in young teens
at the age of fourteen, and over seventy per cent are found in young people between
316                                          13 Emotional Intelligence and Adolescent …

seventeen and twenty. It was also found that the onset of mental disorders begins years
before they were diagnosed. Due to the lack of knowledge and underdeveloped skills
in handling stress and emotional problems, these young people and the adults around
them are usually not aware of the symptoms and consequences of these challenges
until they become mental health issues (Choi, 2018).
    Concerned advocates appeal to school policy makers, education ministers and
school leaders to do more and become more aware of the risk factors that exist in fami-
lies, communities, and those embedded in cultural and traditional values. Apart from
planning and implementing school-wide approaches to support constructive mental
health programs and curricula, schools can promote community efforts to reduce
social factors impacting the mental health of young people. Stronger collaboration
between governmental and educational agencies are required to address problems
such as discrimination, physical violence, bullying, sexual abuse, and social injus-
tice. More attention and joint actions are required to develop collective resilience in
the community with a well-planned and holistic approach to address youth mental
health issues (Darling-Hammond et al., 2020; OECD, 2014).
    A growing number of school systems in the U.S., Canada, and Australia are
integrating school-based trauma-sensitive approaches along with SEL programs and
student welfare policies to address student needs using a restorative rather than a
punitive approach. This kind of approach requires teachers and school leaders to be
sensitive, and understand how adversity or trauma can affect students’ emotions, self-
regulation, relational reactions, and behaviour (Howard, 2019; Stokes & Brunzell,
2019).
    As educators and parents, we have to acknowledge the progress we have made,
but keep in mind that there is still more to be done.

School Leadership and Emotional

on instructional leadership and organisational leadership. This include professional
knowledge in the art of teaching and learning, leading curriculum, knowledge and
skills in organisational management and having a repertoire of people skills. This
chapter discusses the new concepts of collective leadership in the school commu-
nity. It also presents empirical data on how school and teacher leaders at different
levels of leadership explain the importance of emotional intelligence in their lead-
ership development journey, and in their daily practice to connect with the school
community.



14.2 Instructional Leadership

Over the past few decades, discourse on instructional leadership has alternated
between focusing on instructional management, instructional expertise, management
of the curriculum and the behaviour of school principals in effective schools. Schol-
arly analyses in the 2000s have placed a distinct emphasis on ensuring that principals
are able to attain their instructional leadership role with research focuses explicitly
linked to training curricula in major government-led efforts in the USA (Hallinger,
2005, 2011), Australia (Davis, 2003; Ylimaki & Jacobson, 2013), and Hong Kong
(Lam, 2003).
   In line with changing times and societal demands, the literature describing instruc-
tional leadership has shifted focus from supervising classroom instruction to viewing
principals as instructional leaders charged with formulating strategies and outlining
school missions, supervising instructional programs and nurturing positive learning

climates. These roles also involve obtaining necessary resources, improving working
conditions, and aligning actions with the communication of visions and goals
(Hallinger & Heck, 1996; Hallinger et al., 1996; Lambert, 1998). These descrip-
tions contrast with earlier views of principals as directors and instead, underscore
the importance of their role in capacity building.
    Continuous interest in instructional leadership has resulted in widening perspec-
tives and extended attention to non-human factors. Research has found that the struc-
tural composition of a school, such as its size and demography (Elmore, 2002), and the
necessity for cultural change and the effect of the school’s capacity to meet identified
needs (Fullan, 2011), all have a strong impact on instructional leadership. Supporting
factors that can influence pedagogical improvement have also been identified. These
include teacher quality, teacher personality and professional development, appro-
priate pedagogical application and content knowledge, teacher qualifications, and
teacher experience. The notion of collective responsibilities in leading instructional
matters was recognised as a result of this research trend. This illustrates that the
concept of instructional leadership extends beyond the span of the school principal’s
role and necessarily involves other in-school leaders.
    Scholars globally have also kept pace with understanding barriers to effective
instructional implementation. These include teacher attitudes and readiness and
mismatches between teachers’ and administrators’ beliefs about instructional imple-
mentation and deliveries. This has fuelled increased attention on teacher recruitment
and selection, continuous professional development, and their impact on student
learning. The traditional instructional leadership paradigm was also challenged on
the grounds that school principals are not experts in education and do not have exper-
tise in the full range of subject matters, especially at the secondary school level.
Hence, instructional or pedagogical leadership came to be seen as a shared function
between management and classroom teachers, who are trained specialists in their
subjects. Instructional leadership is also seen as ‘everybody’s work’, including mid-
level leaders, department chairs, and classroom teachers (Beswick, 2006; Fullan,
2011; Leithwood & Louis, 2011; Louis et al., 2010; Van Driel et al., 2001).
    To substantiate this argument, Frost (2011) produced empirical evidence that
departmental chairs and mid-level leaders could have a positive influence on teachers
in curriculum matters, and that collegial support and sharing were a source of instruc-
tional strategies for teachers. Other scholars remarked that the principal is responsible
for elevating the performance of teachers and students (Pont et al., 2008) by creating
a conducive environment that includes strategic planning, coordinating and evalu-
ating teaching, and curriculum implementation. Robinson et al. (2008) found in a
meta-analysis that the principal’s role in capacity building through promoting and
participating in teacher learning and development has a strong positive influence on
student improvement. Such improvements became evident when principals adhered
to research-based instruction, connected professional learning with a clear vision
and developed teachers as a collective group (Day & Leithwood, 2007). Fairman and
Mackenzie (2012) also found that classroom teachers become effective instructional
leaders when they move from their own practice to engage in collaborative learning
and sharing with their peers.
14.2 Instructional Leadership                                                         325

    The work of leading a school effectively, once recognised as the function of
a few members of a school management team, is now being considered a shared
responsibility, with teachers as leaders contributing individually or collectively to
achieving outcomes (Schechter & Mowafaq, 2013). Teachers who step out from the
classroom to take on a leadership role need to develop a repertoire of management
and operational skills and capabilities to work with different stakeholders in the
school community. These teacher leaders need to develop capabilities that enable
them to lead in complex situations, using different leadership styles and approaches,
individually and collectively, to carry out their daily duties.
    Scholars who advocate a new approach to preparing school leaders argue that
practising leadership in today’s schools requires new thinking, especially thinking
with a growth mindset (Dweck, 2006; Kaiser & Halbert, 2009). Others point out
the need for developing the capacity to lead with a shared vision and the skills
to set directions. Another important element of this new paradigm of leadership
development is to increase the capability of senior leaders to develop people under
their supervision and understand their development needs (Day et al., 2011; Gurr &
Day, 2014).
    In summary, school principals who were once called upon to be the core instruc-
tional leaders of their schools are now asked to take a new direction and distribute
leadership across the school community, in order to effect sustainable improvements
within the school organisation. They must also take into consideration other dynamics
in the school environment that may enhance or hinder progress whilst also facilitating
instructional leadership.



14.3 Organisational Leadership

Since the beginning of the new millennium, principals and school executive teams in
many advanced countries have been subjected to intense scrutiny and accountability
for honouring policy expectations, ensuring student achievement, and serving the
needs of the school community. Leithwood (2014) states that schools are dynamic
organisations and change in ways that cannot be predicted. He suggests that school
leadership today should be viewed in a new light and proposes that a balance of
instructional and organisational leadership strategies is the best way to create effective
schools to meet demands from changing landscapes of education and leadership.
   Schools are organisations with bureaucratic structures and exist in environments
that are shaped by internal and external forces (Fullan, 2006). Constant changes
are part of the existence of an organization—for example, changes brought about
by new technologies and new cultural and social demands. The impact of these
changes on school leaders has caused leadership scholars to reconceptualise school
leadership and reconsider some of its implications for practice. To complement their
pivotal roles as instructional leaders, school principals must also be organisational
leaders who are required to put in place supportive practices and provide system-wide
leadership development within the school community. School principals today need
326                                      14 School Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

to be organisationally savvy, knowing how to develop and share a vision with the
school community. They need to have the knowledge and skills to influence others
as a way of leading change, and use a range of leadership styles to support change
and lead the organisation.
   Organisational leadership involves more than educational administration and
management. It deals with the human side of organisational management as well
as the operational dimension of the organisation. There are two key components
of organisational leadership identified in the current literature—human capital and
operational management capabilities (Gonzales, 2019; Grissom & Loeb, 2011)—
and these have a direct influence on student learning, as they involve the selection
and development of staff to ensure alignment with student performance and learning
goals. Senior school leaders who are well-versed in human capital management
concepts can influence job satisfaction, provide effective professional development,
and build a supportive culture (Boyd et al., 2011; Harris, 2015). In addition to this,
principals with school operational management abilities have been shown to improve
school learning and student achievement. These capabilities include budget manage-
ment, curriculum choice, facilities and services management, planning and resource
mapping.
   Some scholars declare that although leadership and management overlap, they
are not synonymous (e.g., Bass, 2010; Yukl, 1989). Lalonde (2010) explains that
management is concerned with the day-to-day functioning of an organisation, placing
attention on getting the job done, while organisational leadership is about vision,
focusing attention on the future and on what needs to be done to empower others
and reach goals. Organisational leaders seek to find new solutions to bring about
improvements, while managers and administrators direct the workforce to complete
tasks and meet goals. Principals need to be capable both in organisational leadership
and in management and administration.
   According to Keaster and Schlinker (2009), educators who have undertaken lead-
ership preparation programs that include balanced components of instructional and
organisational leadership went through an interesting transformation. Prior to their
enrolment in the programs, many aspiring school leaders thought that the principal’s
key role was to ensure that teaching and learning took place effectively to meet
set goals. On completion of a preparation program, however, they had developed a
broader view and a new leadership mindset, and acquired a new set of skills and
dispositions that increased their confidence and willingness to lead complex, diverse
and innovative institutions.
   Organisational leadership is described by the Australian Public Service Commis-
sion (2010) as the ability to combine people skills with the organisation’s processes,
systems, culture and structures to deliver business outcomes. To help members of
the public service to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to succeed in the
workplace, a capability framework was established stating technical and operational
requirements, soft skills and strategies. The three major components of the framework
are: (1) leadership capabilities, which include setting directions and motivating and
developing people; (2) strategic capabilities, which include outcome-focused strate-
gies, making evidence-based choices, collaborating and building common purpose;
14.3 Organisational Leadership                                                     327

and (3) delivery capabilities, which include managing performance, sharing commit-
ment and using sound delivery models for planning, resourcing and prioritising, and
engaging innovative delivery. These descriptions can be used as a reference to guide
school leadership in public schools, as they are also part of the public service.
   In North America, the Wallace Foundation, a renowned organisation that supports
evidence-based research in education, has outlined five key functions of organisa-
tional leaders that enhance school success based on their studies and observations
of effective principals. These functions are: shaping a vision, creating a climate
hospitable to education, cultivating leadership in others, improving instruction and
managing people, and using data to foster school improvement (Wallace Foundation,
2013).



14.3.1 Capabilities Required by School Leaders
       in Organisational Leadership

To further illustrate the capabilities required by organisational leaders, this section
highlights some of the most commonly discussed organisational leadership capabili-
ties in contemporary educational literature. These include systems thinking, strategic
thinking, developing self and others, emotional intelligence and resilience, effective
communication and relationship building, and enhancing the use of technology and
innovation.
• Systems thinking and school leadership
  In recent years, there has been a growing realisation of the need to understand
  schools as systems in the education literature. Systems thinking, a concept intro-
  duced by Senge (2008), is the understanding of the linkage of and interactions
  between the elements that compose the entire system. Scholars of educational
  leadership are calling on school leaders to develop systems thinking as part
  of engaging in organisational development and to approach educational assess-
  ment . Recent research has also focused on how the use of systems thinking
  has enhanced leadership skills in mid-level school leaders (Shaked & Schechter,
  2016). In Europe, an emerging trend of teachers taking on roles as systems leaders
  is gaining attention in the literature (e.g., Boylan, 2016; Hargreaves, 2011, 2012).
  School leaders today need to cultivate innovations, expand choices in creative
  problem solving, and lead collective decisions and actions. Systems thinking is a
  needed capability for school leaders (Shaked & Schechter, 2017).
• Strategic thinking and school leadership
  Strategic thinking is the ability to think with a future orientation (Olson &
  Simerson, 2015). While systems thinking looks at education holistically to
  understand the interconnectivity of and relationships between its different parts,
  strategic thinking informs and guides actions and enables success in achieving
  goals. Strategic leadership is a means of building both an organisation’s capacity to
  achieve change and the direction of that change. Strategic leaders define the vision
328                                       14 School Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

  and moral purpose of an organisation and translate them into action. Strategic
  thinking also involves encouraging individual initiative, creating a work envi-
  ronment where quality relationships are valued and trust is foster, promoting the
  capacity to learn, change and adapt in high-velocity environments (Carmeli et al.,
  2010; Davies & Davies, 2010).
• Developing self and others
  Self-development and people development are also seen as essential skills in
  organisational leadership. Self-knowledge is important in enhancing the indi-
  vidual’s ability to make judgements, to create a personal vision for learning and
  growth, understand one’s leadership styles, and manage relationships and work
  priorities with a balanced view (Cardno & Youngs, 2013). Competent leaders
  are those who can leverage individual talent, competencies and skills to promote
  group and organisational achievements. When senior leaders are able to iden-
  tify potential talents in the staff, and help them build their capacity to evolve in
  response to changes and demands, higher levels of organisational success will
  be achieved. Self-awareness of one’s own strengths and development needs is an
  essential part of leadership growth (Charan et al., 2011). Leaders who are aware
  of their own strengths and needed strengths can leverage their own strengths and
  others to achieve goals.
• Emotional intelligence and resilience
  Emotional intelligence is another integral element of leadership in an organisation
  (Goleman, 2013). Studies demonstrate that emotional intelligence is important
  to establishing relationships and leading achievement through creating rapport
  and bonding with others in the workplace. In education, scholars have found that
  teachers with high emotional intelligence are able to relate better to at-risk students
  and those that live in underprivileged environments. They are resilient, usually
  optimistic and positive, and can influence their co-workers and help them bounce
  back from setbacks. Principals with high emotional intelligence are able to build
  cultures of trust and warm support in the school community (Bar-On et al., 2007;
  Brinia et al., 2014).
      Like emotional intelligence, resilience is vital in today’s stressful work environ-
  ment. In the context of organisational leadership, resilient employees are more
  likely to be receptive to necessary organisational changes and show a greater
  capacity for recovery from workplace setbacks.
• Effective communication and relationship building
  Effective communication and relationship building skills are important capabili-
  ties for organisational leaders to have. “Great schools grow when educators under-
  stand that the power of their leadership lies in the strength of their relationships”
  (Donaldson, 2007, p. 29). Studies have found strong communication skills and
  relationship building abilities to be major components of school success. This
  includes leader-member exchanges when leaders are capable of being profes-
  sionally supportive and sincere, and working in collaboration: “If a school is
  truly developing and growing, and if learning is collaborative, each person is a
  leader and follower at various times” (Crippen, 2012, p. 39). Communication and
  relationship building between teachers, school leaders and parents are also vital.
14.3 Organisational Leadership                                                      329

  Parental involvement in schools has been proven to influence student success
  (Harrison & Gold, 2017; Yoder & Lopez, 2013). However, differences in expec-
  tations and the power to influence may sometimes lead to miscommunication; it is
  therefore crucial for teachers and school leaders to be clear in their communication
  and diplomatic in their relationship building (Day, 2017).
• Technology and innovation
  Educational literature in the last decade has also drawn attention to the demand on
  school leaders to utilise technology to lead educational innovations. School leaders
  have an added responsibility to understand and lead the use of digital technology
  as a pedagogical tool and approach (Perez et al., 2010). The “flipped classroom
  model” of learning, a model that guides students to engage with interactive content
  of a subject, has enabled “active learning” and learner-directed engagement to
  allow students to learn at their own pace and level of performance, achieving the
  principles of inclusive education and student equity in learning.
Teachers and school leaders are given professional development to make use of data
and technology to inform curriculum and program planning (Perez et al., 2010) and
student assessments (Knoeppel & Logan, 2011). To support the demands on leading
innovation and technology, leadership preparation in the future must include building
leaders’ capacity to define the organisation’s digital capability to meet the needs of
their schools and to share information via digital platforms.
    As illustrated in this section, the current demands of organisational leadership are
vast and multifaceted and cannot be met by an individual school leader or a small
group of school executives. A different approach to leadership is therefore essential—
one that moves from hierarchical entities to a flatter, matrix-type structure in order
to respond to complexity, uncertainty and fast-changing demands.



14.4 The Era of Collective Leadership

Contemporary descriptions of leadership are shifting away from a focus on a sole
leader toward the concept of collective leadership. It is evident in the literature that
leadership is no longer considered the sole province of the principal (MacBeath &
Dempster, 2009; OECD, 2013), and that while the principal is the pivot of school
leadership, responsibility for the implementation of effective learning needs to be
shared and distributed (Bolden, 2011; Crawford, 2012).
   In the wider literature, collective leadership has been discussed in different
constructs and practices with key focus on leader-team exchange, team commu-
nication, leader networks, team networks and social support to enhance the affective
climate. In earlier literature on collective leadership, attention was focused on under-
standing how leaders utilise networks to develop and increase their skills by sharing
insights with other leaders and on different ways of distributing leadership in the
organisation. These leader networks also contribute to developing leaders through
different stages, as they provide development opportunities to support emergent
330                                      14 School Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

leadership, informal leadership and other key leadership performance (Crawford,
2012).
    Since the year 2000, literature on collective leadership has discussed the increas-
ingly common organisational practice of assigning leadership at different levels of
management and operations using teams and multiple leaders. Studies of this nature
focused on the importance of understanding team dynamics and the flow of infor-
mation within groups (Mehra et al., 2006), team structure and team-level processes
(Uhl-Bien & Marion, 2009), and utilising teams to increase innovation and adapt-
ability within the organisation (Friedrich et al., 2010). Numerous studies have focused
on leaders and team exchange. In an organisation where collective leadership is
practised, leaders need to learn how to handle different views and directives, both
logistical and relational. Communication is vital to ensure that team members have
a common understanding of objectives, goals and problems to solve. Friedrich and
Mumford (2009) highlight the capability of leaders to engage in sense-giving, to
make sure that objectives or processes make sense to team members engaged in a
work task.
    Studies on the topic of team support, whether work-related or social and emotional,
found that leaders can create organisational conditions for emotional expression to
foster an affective climate (Barsade & Gibson, 2007), and assist in coping with work-
related stress. Similarly, Sonnentag and Frese (2003) have also made a connection
between affect and relevant collective leadership concepts such as communication,
relational exchange, feedback, conflict and support networks.
    In education, collective leadership can be enacted in different ways, for example,
in leading subject-planning teams, or cross-curriculum committees (Anderson,
2012), and chairing or leading functional community programs and parent-teacher
committees. Additionally, distributed leadership appears to be a popular discus-
sion topic in the global practice of collective leadership (e.g., Crowther et al.,
2009; Dufour & Marzano, 2011). Spillane (2006, p. 15) defines distributed lead-
ership as a collective, interactive approach to leading, with leadership “stretched
over multiple leaders” using a non-linear and non-hierarchical approach. In consid-
ering the effects of distributed leadership, Woods and Gronn (2009) list four main
benefits: increased effectiveness; increased engagement and self-esteem; enhanced
organisational capacity; and greater sharing of leadership burdens.
    For distributed leadership to work efficiently, the social dimension of the concept
must be stressed. Distributed leadership can only thrive in a climate of trust and
well-established relationships that are supported by a well-designed organisational
restructure away from the traditional school model and toward one that engages
in flatter, more lateral decision-making processes (Hargreaves, 2012; Hargreaves &
Fink, 2006).
    Today, school principals are encouraged to embrace collective leadership as a
new measure of school leadership. The facilitation of distributed leadership requires
specific skills and capabilities, and a sound understanding of each school’s specific
situation and context to make the operation effective. Principals and senior school
leaders need to develop these skills, and gain experience, in order to mobilise others
in collective and distributed responsibilities (Bolden, 2011; Leithwood et al., 2009).
14.5 School Leadership and EI                                                       331

14.5 School Leadership and EI

As interests expand in leadership and EI, scholars in school leadership studies also
contributed to the literature on the importance of EI in school management and
leadership in the school community. One study in the US found that primary school
principals with high EQ scores showed more effective leadership (Munroe, 2009). In
two other similar studies, Berkovich and Eyal (2015) declare that the job of a school
principal is emotionally laden, having to deal with competing objectives, meeting
multi-directional demands from the internal and external school environment, and
Maxwell and Riley (2017) affirm that instructional leaders face tremendous pressure
from all angles in the school community and it is emotionally draining. Fullan (2015)
adds to this view by pointing out that on top of other leadership demands, school
leaders are expected to handle the emotional demands of their teachers, students and
the school community and stresses the importance of equipping school leaders with
knowledge, skills and capabilities to face these challenges.
   In today’s fast evolving and dynamic school environment, school leaders need to
know how to understand and handle the emotional demands on themselves and their
staff. However, some researchers found that not many school leaders are given the
needed learning and development preparation to help them strengthen their emotional
intelligence and related skills and capabilities (Singh et al., 2007; Hebert, 2011).
Voices for more input into the study of emotional intelligence as part of preparatory
programs for principals and school leaders are getting louder (e.g., Leithwood et al.,
2004; Mills, 2009; Singh et al., 2007).
   In an earlier study, I have collected qualitative data from teachers of NSW Australia
to learn about their challenges as classroom teachers, teacher leaders and execu-
tive school leaders (Gonzales, 2019). The following presents these data on how
class teachers and school leaders at different levels of leadership described the chal-
lenges they faced and the emotional demands on them in their daily professional life.
The sample was a small one comprising 35 teachers and principals from different
demographic areas of NSW, Australia.
   These participants were given code names as CT (classroom teacher), TL (teacher
leader), HT (head teacher), AP (assistant principal), DP (Deputy principal) and P
(principal).



14.5.1 The Most Common Challenges Faced by Teachers
       and School Leaders

This first set of data reports the three most common challenges faced by the partici-
pants as a core group—teachers, mid-level leaders and senior leaders. The challenges
include: handling difficult situations and challenging people, the need to develop
higher emotional intelligence and stronger resilience, balancing time and priorities.
332                                            14 School Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

• Handling difficult situations and challenging people
One of the most common challenges identified in this study included dealing with
challenging situations presented by students, parents, and colleagues. Over half of
the teacher participants claimed they needed to strengthen their conflict resolu-
tion skills and build their capacity to “remain relaxed” and not get “emotionally
overwhelmed” to “resolve challenging situations in a professional manner”. The
challenges they reported manifested in different ways in their school environments,
including tension between teachers and parents, disagreements between supervisors
and staff or between colleagues, and polarisation of values and expectations amongst
stakeholders.
    Parental aggression in the school environment was found to be the biggest chal-
lenge for many teachers, which was illustrated with comments including “rude
and loud complaints”, “intimidating postures” and “confrontational tones” . These
comments were in line with the findings of several studies (e.g., Jaksec, 2003,
2005) which found increased parental aggression toward teachers in the US public
school system. Engaging with parents and carers to enhance students’ learning is a
professional practice expected by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers
(2011), (Standards 3.7, 5.5 and 7.3). Teachers and school leaders who participated
in this study generally acknowledged that they share with parents the common goal
of helping students to achieve or overcome identified problems. However, as TL5
pointed out, “by acting in an intimidating way, they (some parents) feel a sense of
power and control, resulting in escalating the situation”. Facing emotionally charged
parents and remaining calm is not easy.
    Amongst the participants who expressed a need to develop stronger conflict
management skills, CT2 identified assertiveness training as a development need that
would enable her to better handle conflicts with parents:
   The most common complaints from parents are that their child is not given enough attention,
   there is too much homework, not enough homework, so and so is bullying my child. Many
   parents came complaining without finding out the truth. Sometimes I feel like a punching
   bag for these parents to vent their frustrations. Maybe I’m too soft and polite. I want to
   learn how to be more assertive and how to be more diplomatic in deflecting these rude and
   unreasonable verbal attacks. (CT2, Sydney south west primary school)

Conflict situations arise when people hold different perceptions and expectations.
Participants indicated that conflicts between teachers and students or parents, and
conflicts between staff members and unit supervisors, occur occasionally in their
schools. DP5 related the challenges of communicating with people who are perceived
as “demanding, uncooperative, or arrogant” and pointed out “that having the ability
to resolve these conflicts depends on the individual’s communication style and expe-
rience”. One assistant principal considered seeking coaching to help strengthen her
conflict resolution skills.
   The biggest challenge is when people have an ‘us and them’ mentality. They get into cliques
   and gossip and backstab one another. Some of them tried to be deliberately difficult when
   asked to contribute. Most of the time, people do not realise that these behaviours can impact
14.5 School Leadership and EI                                                                   333

   staff morale. I have read books about it but without support, it is hard. I think the most
   effective ways to help me with this challenge is to have a coach who can help me assess the
   different aspects of the problems and help with some suggestions to deal with them. (AP1
   Sydney north Primary)

Mid-level leaders revealed difficulties in discussing issues with staff members who
were not contributing, demotivated, or being uncooperative. This was a challenge
identified by both mid-level leaders and some senior leaders. One assistant prin-
cipal was particularly vocal about her development needs in giving feedback as a
supervisor:
   I find giving feedback to some staff members rather challenging. I need to develop skills
   in communicating in a way that they do not take feedback as criticism or an attack, which
   will put them on the offensive or lead to resentment. The challenging ones are those nearing
   retirement and have an attitude. (AP3, NSW regional primary)

Offering her insights gained from experience, P5 indicated that “it is imperative
that employee performance issues are dealt with quickly and efficiently. Having the
ability to give effective feedback can help to motivate staff members and resolve
issues before they become problematic”. She added that this was a needed skill
amongst novice supervisors, a skill that is learnt through mentoring and practice.
    As participants made clear, in today’s complex environment, conflict management
is an area in which school leaders need professional development to prevent conflict
from reaching damaging levels or escalating into formal disputes.
• The need to develop stronger resilience and emotional intelligence
The second most mentioned area of attention from teachers and school leaders is
strengthening emotional intelligence as a development need. In identifying it as
a needed skill in today’s stressful workplace, participants recognised the need to
manage conflict and learn to communicate more effectively with people who are
perceived as “challenging”. In the following example, a team leader acknowledged
his need to increase his emotional intelligence in order to manage his emotions,
handle challenges and defuse conflicts:
   I’d like to have the opportunity to strengthen my skills in handling conflicts, perhaps to
   increase my emotional intelligence. Sometimes I felt I am caught in situations when I felt
   I could handle the situation better if I had the proper skills. You see, not all conflicts are
   alike. A confrontation with an angry parent is very different from a personal tiff between
   co-workers. I feel that if I had some formal training, I’d feel more confident when handling
   these challenging situations. (TL3, Sydney north high school)

Here, TL3 identifies conflict management with emotional intelligence, recognising
that there is no single, straightforward way to handle conflicts. His desire for further
training in using the concept of emotional intelligence endorses the theory that
conflict management involves a multistep process comprising assessment, analysis,
monitoring and negotiation, a capability that is developed and practised over time
(Brinia et al., 2014).
    In addition to emotional intelligence, participants also mentioned the need to
develop resilience, which they described in different ways. For some, resilience meant
334                                            14 School Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

“the ability to adapt well to change”; for others, it was “the ability to recover from
setbacks” or to “become mentally stronger”. These comments show that resilience
is important to teachers because the evolving student demographic inevitably brings
about changes, and increasing demands on class teachers to do more while seemingly
achieving less:
   I became a teacher because I believe that I can make a difference in helping students achieve
   educational success. With the constant change these days, I find I’m not coping well. I need
   to strengthen my ability to adapt well to change. I feel I have lost my confidence and the
   pride I used to have when I was younger. Now I have no sense of accomplishment. Yes, I
   need some coping skills, to learn how to be more resilient. (TL7, NSW regional primary
   school)

TL7 illustrated how stress and work pressures have impacted his self-esteem and
self-efficacy. He wished to develop more skills to harness his resilience and bounce
back from adversity, conflict and workplace challenges.
    In a more recent study, Day and Gu (2014) suggested that due to the multidimen-
sional nature of stress faced by teachers, they need strategies to build their resilience.
To achieve this, Edwards (2010) defined resilience as a process of positive adaptation
that can be developed with specific competencies. Participants in this study were self-
aware of their need to develop resilience and identified it as part of their professional
development. The findings on this theme also correspond with recent discussions
on the importance of building teachers’ resilience by boosting their emotional intel-
ligence, in order to prevent burnout and stress caused by heavy workloads, poor
student behaviour and a perceived lack of appreciation (Day & Gu, 2014). The need
to increase attention to develop school leaders’ emotional intelligence is apparent in
the data captured.
• Balancing time and priorities
Concerns over teachers achieving work-life balance via the ability to balance time
and priorities have increased in the last decade as indicated in the literature (e.g.,
Bushra & Yasir, 2014; Maeran et al., 2013). In his latest book, Day (2017) stresses the
necessity to understand the complexity of the work environment and the importance
of supporting teachers to maintain work-life balance, to reduce stress and prevent
burnout. In this study, 40% of the participants communicated the need to develop
strategies to achieve a work-life balance:
   I need people to help me with how to balance the juggling act. I always have something new
   to learn, something else to share with others, just so much to do. It seems that my work is
   never complete. I sometimes feel so overwhelmed. (C2, Sydney south west primary school)

In his third year as a teacher, CT1 said that he often felt that his work and personal
life were out of balance. He attributed this problem to his lack of experience in
prioritising, but was not able to find enough support to deal with this issue:
   I need to learn to use my time wisely and not to put too much pressure on myself. There is
   so much to do and even though I know I need to separate my work life from my home life, it
   is a very hard thing to do, and I don’t know where and how to get help. I have spoken to my
   colleagues, but they don’t seem to have any concrete or practical suggestions. They seem to
   be struggling with this too. (C1, Sydney north primary school)
14.5 School Leadership and EI                                                                  335

Some mid-level leaders who were charged with mentoring younger teachers have
also observed this phenomenon:
    Young teachers tend to take on too much as they are passionate about their work, especially
    the talented ones. And others tend to call on these talented ones to do jobs that they don’t
    want to do, or are not confident doing. So, these young talented ones tend to feel burnt out
    eventually. As a mentor, I always remind them to take it slowly and be aware of how much
    they can handle, and not to put too much pressure on themselves. (HT3, Sydney north high
    school)

The findings regarding participants’ concerns over work-life balance correspond
with studies from Day and his colleagues, who found that teachers today face not
just work-related demands but also demands from their personal lives (Day, 2017;
Day & Gu, 2014), prompting the urgent need for organisational leaders to create a
work environment that prioritises work-life balance.



14.5.2 Challenges and Demands at Different Stages
       of the Professional Journey

The path of a career transition is usually filled with new challenges, which may be
both stress-inducing and rewarding at the same time. These career transitions may
include joining the workforce after graduating from a university, returning to work
after childbirth, or a long break, moving to a new state or country, or being promoted
to a more senior position. The following are participants’ views and insights into
their transitional experiences.
• Psychosocial needs in job transition
Psychosocial needs include the needs to find a sense of self within a larger social
environment, the need to find a sense of individuality and fitting into society as
a whole. A psychosocial lens in leadership transition helps to understand how the
surrounding social environment impacts the physical and mental wellness of an
individual and their ability to function (Woodward, 2015).
   The psychosocial needs during leadership transition identified in this part of the
study include:
•   developing a sense of belonging (14%)
•   developing a professional identity (14%)
•   a need for peer acceptance (17%).
•   a need for social support and friendship (26%)
The need for social support and friendship development and the desire to develop
a sense of belonging were stronger amongst classroom teachers than other lead-
ership groups. The following illustrate participants experiences and emotions with
qualitative data from the study.
336                                              14 School Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

• A sense of belonging
Workplace loneliness when transitioning between roles was described as a challenge
by three classroom teachers (CT), one head teacher(HT) and one deputy principal
(DP). For some, the development of connections with their colleagues took longer
than anticipated due to personality differences, generational differences and even
racial and cultural differences. For example, CT3 related the challenges posed by her
own personality and highlighted the psychosocial aspects of transition into a new
environment:
   When I was younger, I was very shy. To others, I appeared aloof or uninterested, but I just
   did not know how to join in a conversation. I was very lonely. I usually sat quietly watching
   people chitchatting enthusiastically, but I was not a joiner. It took me a long time to learn to
   socialise. Some of my co-workers were very nice to me, some just ignored me. Now I am
   more conversational. I have learned the skills. My advice to people is to be more self-aware
   and make the effort to come out of your shell if you are a super-introvert like me. (CT3,
   Sydney west primary school)

Being aware of her personality traits and the impact of the negative elements of
these traits has helped CT3 to develop emotionally and socially. This highlights the
importance of self-awareness as a school leadership capability in leading self.
   Two of the interview participants candidly discussed their social transition needs
related to gossip and the lack of social support. CT2, who has been in her current
school for five years, reflected on how the discomfort she experienced in a previous
role hindered her development of a sense of belonging:
   When I first started teaching, not in this school, in another school, people loved to gossip, and
   I hated that. I seldom joined in staff morning tea because I did not like to hear backstabbing
   comments. I was very unhappy in that school. (CT2, Sydney SW primary school)

In the workplace, gossip is a naturally-occurring social phenomenon and it is impor-
tant for all leaders to understand its implications for organisations, because it can
be a form of social mistreatment and have an impact on both the gossipers and their
unfortunate targets (Farley et al., 2010).
    Despite teachers being professionals, many are not aware of the negative effects
of the gossip and rumours they spread, probably seeing them as a social glue to
bond with co-workers (Farley et al., 2010). CT2, who did not share this social value,
“hated” this kind of behaviour and was unhappy in the environment.
   Luckily, I got a new position in another school after a year. People are nice in this school,
   very friendly and no gossips. (CT2, Sydney SW primary school)

The examples given by CT3 and CT2 prompt attention to social support for
newcomers to a school community and sensitivity to the contextual nature of support
expectations and perceptions among newcomers as they interact with their workplace
communities.
14.5 School Leadership and EI                                                                      337

• Development of a professional identity
Professional identity is described as a form of self-awareness based on an ideal
model and an expectation of goals to be achieved (Vignoles et al., 2011). It impacts
the development of self-confidence as well as overall performance at work. Six
interview participants identified the process of developing a professional identity as
a transition need. Their descriptions included experiences as young teachers trying
to establish their professional identities and receiving acceptance from their peers,
building relationships with the school community, and meeting the professional stan-
dards and expectations. Two examples are presented to illustrate the transition chal-
lenges faced by a graduate transitioning into a class teacher role, and a teacher from
another country trying to fit into a new environment.
    CT6, a young teacher from a regional primary school, stepped into her classroom
determined to live up to her childhood dream to establish her professional identity as
“not just a teacher but a ‘good teacher’”. In her transition from a graduate to a class
teacher, she was confronted with a reality shock and described in emotive terms how
she was “let down”, “stunned and disappointed” and “felt lost”:
   Unfortunately, I felt so let down when I realised that teaching is more complex than what I had
   observed from my revered teachers as a student. I was stunned and somewhat disappointed
   because my students seemed to lack so many of the foundation skills and prior knowledge
   relevant to their grade level. I also came to the realisation that regardless of how effective my
   teaching strategies were with one group of students; they did not work with other groups.
   Sometimes I felt lost. (CT6, NSW regional primary school).

Her high expectations of herself and the lack of information on her students’ back-
grounds compounded her disappointment in the lack of resources and support from
senior leaders in a small regional primary school.
   One teacher, who joined the Australian teacher workforce from overseas, felt
challenged as she attempted to cross cultural borders to establish her teacher identity
in an Australian school, and shared her experience on how she had to overcome
adversity related to her racial difference:
   It does not matter how well-qualified you are, when you speak with an accent, people
   immediately second-rate you. I do not think my accent is very strong, but I certainly do not
   speak like a native Aussie […] Coming from a different culture, I have different views on
   teaching strategies. These were often disregarded in team meetings, and I felt diminished,
   robbed of my professional identity as a highly-regarded teacher in my own country. (CT4,
   Sydney west School for specific needs)

These two responses unmask some embedded dilemmas faced by new beginner class-
room teachers in transition, either from university to the real classroom or another
school, or even when crossing international boundaries. As teachers move into a
new environment with unique cultural values, they need support to help them under-
stand the interplay between their self-perceptions and the professional expectations
of the organisation in order to develop a positive professional identity. Access to
appropriate, supportive transition arrangements can reduce barriers for newcomers.

14.5.3 Transition Challenges from Teaching to School
       Leadership

Participants of the study were also asked to describe some of the challenges they met
in the process of stepping out of the classroom and taking up additional leadership
role in mid-level school leadership, such as in the role of a head teacher or assistance
principal. The following challenges were identified:
• Transition needs in people management
Transition needs in the area of people management were reported by mid-level (head
teachers and assistant principals) and senior leaders (deputy principals and princi-
pals). These two tiers of leaders described their transitional challenges as: becoming
problem solvers; learning to lead through others and delegating, knowing how to
give feedback tactfully and constructively; and leading collaborative learning and
planning.
• Becoming a problem-solver
A common challenge identified from the information provided by this group of
leaders was the demand placed on them to become problem solvers. The range
of problems thrown to them included everything from equipment breakdowns, team
member conflicts and teacher-parent conflicts to curriculum-related matters, resource
planning and distribution, scheduling times and locations, and problems caused by
miscommunication. Mid-level leaders used a number of metaphors to describe the
intensity of this shift. For example, HT3 claimed that her new role was “an emotional
roller coaster” causing her “tremendous stress”. AP2 stated “suddenly, life was a
chain of problems waiting to be solved”, the word “suddenly” denoting inadequate
preparation and unforeseen expectations.
   The most mentioned issues about problem solving were framed around handling
challenging students, pointing to the standard recurrent problem of having chal-
lenging and disruptive students sent to them or DPs during class time. HT2 described
how he has learnt through experience to frame these problems using a strategic
mindset:
   When I was new to the job, I felt compelled to handle the problems and prove my prowess
   as a good leader, and I wanted to fix every problem. Behaviour management is teamwork.
   A concerted team effort is required in solving challenging student behaviour. With more
   experience now, I’ve learnt to bring my team together and we would brainstorm ideas on
   how to be consistent in our practice, on planning strategies to help students develop self-
   regulation skills, and on designing learning activities that would engage these students. (HT2,
   Sydney north high school)

This remark is consistent with previous observations that student behavioural prob-
lems bring with them a string of underlying factors that need to be looked at, such
as cultural and contextual factors. Leaders moving from classroom management to
people management need to develop relevant capabilities to mobilise collective input
and make necessary changes.
14.5 School Leadership and EI                                                                      339

• Learning to lead through others and delegations
A majority of the participants claimed that they learnt to cope with their transition
challenges mainly through self-taught strategies, trial and error, and experience. AP2
shared her narrative of how she developed her specialist expertise through time and
experience when the inclusion of children with autism was still a new concept eight
years ago:
   I knew very little at that time on how to support these students, especially the more challenging
   ones with autism who had difficulties following classroom rules and getting along with other
   children. I was not alone, my principal and DP supported me a lot, but it still made me
   feel inadequate as a leader because I was not able to give the kind of support that many
   class teachers needed. I attended some professional training but what I found most helpful
   was learning from specialist teachers, talking to parents and therapists, and observing class
   teachers. It took a couple of years for all of us to learn and cope and now we are all confident,
   and we work closely with parents, and they are happy and feel supported. (AP2, Sydney north
   primary school)

This retrospective account confirmed the statements made by other mid-level leaders
about being regarded as problem solvers, and being expected to intervene and meet
the diverse needs of different student groups. For AP2, despite being thrown into
the deep end of the unknown, she had support from her seniors, and with time
and experience, they worked collegially to provide needed services to students with
special needs. AP2 now mentors aspiring teacher leaders to prepare them for the role
based on her own experiences and transition challenges.
• People management and giving feedback
While a newly promoted leader needs to adjust to their new leadership identity, so
do the followers who were once their peers. Two assistant principals and three head
teachers reported sudden feelings of isolation and found that co-workers and friends
suddenly became critics. This adjustment period was testing and impacted on their
social and emotional well-being:
   At the beginning, I was very uncomfortable having to deal with people who were critical
   or highly defensive and emotional when they disagree with issues. I did not know how
   to manage a pushback, or confront a direct report who frequently engage in undermining
   behaviour. I felt threatened especially with more matured staff who have been here for many
   years. Luckily, my DP always backed me up and she taught me how to manage my anxiety
   and how to ask questions, instead of telling. Successful people know how to ask the right
   questions instead of telling. I’m still not very good with that. (HT 1, NSW regional high
   school)

HT3 offered the following insight to future mid-level leaders: “it is important to
realise that when you’ve taken up the role of a head teacher, you have crossed the
boundary. You need to communicate differently and form new relationships with
your colleagues. You need to make mental adjustments to fit into the new role”.
This advice is congruent with the three stages of leadership transition described by
Bridges (2009, pp. 27–76), which are to let go of the past and enter a neutral zone,
launch a new beginning, and continue to learn to deal with consistent change.
340                                             14 School Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

• Leading and engaging in collaborative activities
Teachers value their autonomy and, in the past, have generally worked indepen-
dently. Now, they are increasingly being encouraged to work together and engage
in collaborative planning and implementing school projects. The concept of collab-
oration centres on leaders developing their team members at all levels by letting go
of ‘control’ and sharing development opportunities that will help others to step up
and develop their own leadership and professional skills (Lumby, 2013). However,
responses from the participants (28%) revealed a discrepancy in the understanding
of collaboration, and a perceived deficit of skills in leading collaborative interactions
to effect connection and commitment.
   Call me old fashioned but I don’t really understand collaboration. Well, I assume, when it
   is done properly, it works, but most of the time, it is just allocation of work given a fancy
   name. First of all, it is hard to reach a decision when everyone puts out a suggestion, and
   you know, when you are not in a position of influence, your idea never counts, you’d think,
   why bother? This means, the majority must conform to the more powerful ones in the group.
   After a few times, you just wait to be assigned the work, and do what you have to do. You
   can see this in the kids doing collaborative projects. Some don’t even bother to contribute.
   They rely on the domineering ones to do all the work or to tell them what to do. Perhaps I
   need some PL (professional learning) to convince me. (C5, NSW regional high school)

In describing her need to increase her understanding of collaboration, C5 pointed
out the reality of ‘collaboration’ when frictions arise through competition of ideas
and the ambiguity of the process. She highlighted the power play involved and that
people need more training and understanding of the term ‘collaboration’, and reflect
on the current state of play in staff assignment and classroom projects.
   Collaborative leadership is about building trust, breaking down silos and gener-
ating a culture of planning and working together, leveraging the different talents,
skills and experiences of different members of the organisation or group (AITSL,
2012). To do this requires training and a shift in the leader’s thinking about what
effective collaboration is, and how it can be achieved to maximise collective effort.
   Leading collaboration is hard. It requires time and practice and a strong sense of team. In
   my experience, I am able to lead effectively with some groups and less effectively with
   other groups. It also depends on the nature of the project. If it is something that everyone is
   passionate about, it is easy. When it is a task which is novel or one that encompasses different
   views, it is harder. It is a skill that requires fine tuning. I want to spend some time studying
   it and applying new approaches for different situations. I think it is a development area that
   all teachers need. (DP4, Sydney west high school)

This response substantiates and extends on what C5 pointed out, and advocates further
training and development for teachers and school leaders. Professional collaboration
comprises different layers of elements rooted in deep relationships, which require
trust, leadership skills and communication skills. To inform plans for further skill
development in leading and engaging in authentic collaboration to increase collective
contributions, an inspection of the school community’s work culture and its readiness
for collaborative work is necessary (Crowther, 2015; Lumby, 2013).
14.5 School Leadership and EI                                                                 341

14.5.4 Transitioning from Mid-Level Leadership to Senior
       Leadership

Evidence captured through the stories from mid-level leaders discussed in the
previous section establishes that mid-level leadership roles provide the training
ground from which teachers learn to generate ideas through others and define reason-
able alternatives to resolve problems. Additionally, the experiences gained in mid-
level leadership can play a large role in preparing these leaders for senior leadership.
However, according to Bridges (2009), moving to the third tier of leadership requires
another shift in mindset and capability: the capability of thought leadership. Key
themes captured in this study described these elements of thought leadership. They
included: learning to adopt a big-picture lens and developing visionary thinking skills,
developing strategic thinking skills, matching the values of the school community,
bringing necessary changes to create a new school culture, mentoring and coaching.
• Big-picture thinking and strategic thinking
Three senior leaders (two DPs and one P) identified the ability to think strategically
as an important transitional capability when moving from mid-level leadership to
senior leadership. The term ‘strategic thinking’ may have different meanings for
people in different fields, so these senior leaders were asked to explain the concept
and how they applied strategic thinking in their roles, as well as how they developed
this capability before and after their transition to their current roles. One principal
stated that:
   The shift from mid-level leadership to senior leadership is learning how to be visionary.
   Mid-level leaders are exposed to visionary development before becoming DPs as they are
   part of the school executive team, and they contribute to the annual school plan and other
   future planning. (P1, Sydney north primary school)

Here, P1 linked strategic thinking with developing the annual school plan using a
collaborative approach with the executive team, thus giving mid-level leaders the
opportunity to develop the capability before advancing to senior leadership.
    In contrast, one DP interpreted strategic thinking differently and clarified how it
is applied in the daily operation of leadership at their level:
   Many people think that strategic thinking is only what principals do. Everyone can be a
   strategic thinker. It is about having a vision, a goal and then planning how to achieve the
   goal. It is about setting directions and then prioritising activities. I have always been a
   strategic thinker but being a Deputy Principal, I needed to strengthen my strategic thinking
   at a different level so that I can support people and guide them to achieve goals. I have
   to think through the challenges faced by my staff and make some workable plans to help
   them overcome obstacles or fear, or discomfort, when we need to implement change. (DP1,
   Sydney north high school)

Following a similar line of thought, DP5 defined being strategically minded as having
“the ability to apply strategic concepts to make complex decisions based on reliable
342                                             14 School Leadership and Emotional Intelligence

information”. Over half of the senior leaders also linked strategic thinking with estab-
lishing organisational goals, strategic resourcing and planning as a core component
of educational management.
• Matching the values and culture of the school community
For principals who move to a new school to take up their new role, one of the biggest
transitional adjustments is fitting into the culture of their new workplace. P2, a very
experienced principal in the NSW public school system, testified to her experience
of being a mismatch for the school culture when she acted as a caretaker principal
for a school that held values opposite to hers:
   I was asked to be a caretaker principal because there was a sudden change in that school,
   until they found a new one. Unfortunately, when a school is going through change, the
   parents feel insecure, the staff feel insecure, and therefore, there were more complaints than
   necessary. I could see the change that I need to make but the school community held a
   very different cultural view. They did not see the need to increase attention to academic
   improvement because the school had always valued a sports culture. Fortunately, they found
   a new principal soon enough and this principal seemed to be a better fit for the culture. (P2,
   Sydney north primary school)

P2 walked into a school that held opposing cultural values to hers and realised that
she was not a fit for its culture. Whilst she valued a culture of academic excellence
through active learning and quality pedagogical input, the school community of that
school regarded sports as their major priority. P2 realised that it would take her
tremendous time and effort to lead a cultural change and was glad that it was only a
temporary position. Understanding cultural fit is a selection criterion in the corporate
recruitment process of many organisations (Sarala & Vaara, 2010), indicating that
this is a capability that candidates must have to be qualified to advance to positions
of senior leadership. This capability forms an essential base for pre-role preparation
and support.
• Bringing necessary changes to create a new school culture
From another perspective, one principal highlighted sensitivity toward the increas-
ingly multicultural nature of school populations in regions where ethnic diversity is
growing. Knowing how to approach and handle the social reality of the changing
cultural demands on schools is an essential capability for senior school leaders when
leading the organisation and the community. P1, a senior school leader with vast
experience, shared his insights into this issue:
   We are a multicultural school as you can see, and we value diversity. The previous school
   that I worked in as a DP was also very multicultural, with a majority of students with Asian
   backgrounds. When I became a principal of this school, I actively reached out to parents
   and listened to their expectations. I consulted with the staff and the director, and we started
   running bilingual classes for Chinese and Korean children. Also, as you can see, over half
   of our staff here are also from Asian backgrounds. My point is, being a leader of the school,
   you need to be clear of your vision and how the vision matches with the school and the
   changing demography of the school community. (P1, Sydney north primary school)
14.5 School Leadership and EI                                                                    343

The responses of P1 and P2 confirm the importance of developing sensitivity to
cultural values and understanding as senior leadership skills, matching the current
discussion on the importance of leadership in culturally-diverse schools (Davis et al.,
2015; DeMatthews & Mawhinney, 2014). Both leaders reported developing this capa-
bility via experience and insights gained from previous roles. However, for novice
principals who might not have such experience, the mismatch between leadership
and community demands can lead to problems. This highlights another aspect of
transition support for school leaders in transition to senior leadership.
• Mentoring and coaching
Both mid-level and senior level leaders are responsible for mentoring or coaching
staff members at different levels to help them develop their professional skills. A
mentor guides and shares specific technical skills and knowledge with a mentee,
while a coach inspires and lead a ‘coachee’ to think of solutions and plan goals
for future growth and actions. A skilled mentor can be both a mentor and a coach
at different stages when helping a developing staff member to grow, but a good
relationship between the mentor and mentee is vital to the success of the mentoring
process (Ingersoll & Strong, 2011). Mentors given the responsibility of mentorship
without training and development in this area may do more harm than good, as this
narrative from one respondent shows:
   I’d like to develop some skills in mentoring. I am very lucky to have a DP who is a brilliant
   mentor. She is very objective in her approaches and did not impose her ways. Sometimes
   we discussed issues that we did not agree on, and she let me decide what would work best
   for me. She is patient with me and frank to point out how I could do better by giving me
   a range of suggestions. Unlike my friend who was paired with a rather controlling mentor,
   and it gave him a year of hell. He quit and has gone into the IT world where he is now very
   happy. But he is so talented and good with kids. What a waste! (TL4, Sydney west primary
   school)

It is, as indicated by TL4, important that mentors know their own limitations and seek
to develop their mentoring skills, as self-awareness is always a process of refining
and polishing one’s skills further, as AP4 pointed out:
   I love mentoring. Working with young teachers energises me. Mentoring is a mutual learning
   process; you learn from them, and they learn from you. I find that I tend to give too much
   advice and I find myself constantly curbing my urge to fix things. It has to do with my ego,
   I now realise. As a mentor, you have to be careful with what you tell them. It is better to ask
   and give them options. Don’t give them the answer. I am still refining my mentoring skills.
   That would be one of my development needs. (AP4, Sydney west primary school)

Mentoring young teachers is listed as one of the roles of a Lead Teacher in the
Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (AITSL, 2011). Classroom teachers
who wish to be accredited as Lead Teachers must provide evidence of their ability to
mentor and support new teachers in conjunction with their principal or deputy prin-
cipal. Currently, to reinforce this development, the NSW Department of Education
has established a Leadership Development Initiative with online resources to support
the development of leadership skills to help school leaders strengthen supporting and
mentoring abilities.

    The data captured on transitional challenges and support for school leaders clearly
indicate that leadership transitions can be and are stress-generating when the new
position demands instantaneous leaps and expansion in the scope of responsibility.
Factors disclosed by interview participants indicated that clarity around the expec-
tations of new roles was lacking during and after their transitions. School leaders in
transition were riding the wave of prior successes, probably as outstanding instruc-
tional leaders meeting selection criteria for the position guided by current teacher and
principal standards. As evident in their responses, many of the transition challenges
they faced were people-related rather than learning- or instruction-related, suggesting
that a stronger focus on organisational leadership capability and awareness of one’s
strengths in these capabilities is vital pre-transition groundwork.
    Transition support takes place at both the individual and the organisational level.
At the individual level, leaders in transition need to reassess their own strengths and
vulnerabilities and prepare a self-development agenda. They need to know where
they can access a support network and prepare themselves by talking to leaders at
the level they aim to pursue, to find out about the range of challenges they might
encounter. An understanding of the range of emotional strains during this period
of adjustment may make the transition less stressful. Learning how to be open and
enlist the help of others may also ease the pressure of fearing being judged when
facing challenges in the new role. In the corporate world, leaders in transition are
supported by assessment tools to help them identify their needed strengths . With
evidence pointing to a need for these, access to such tools and how to administer
them will assist leadership transition for school leaders.
    At the organisation level, awareness of transition support as a vital component of
talent management in a school system. Transition support is part of a comprehensive
talent management system. To prepare for more effective leadership development,
school systems would benefit from learning more about talent management and
succession planning. When senior school leaders are aware of the transitional needs
of staff members before, during and after their advancement to a leadership position,
and provide the needed transitional support it will empower those staff members to
climb the learning curve quickly and attain professional fulfilment and confidence
in their new roles.
    This chapter has presented a synthesis of current views of school leadership and
the demands faced by current school leaders with a range of scholarly works in
the literature of educational leadership. It highlights the importance of collective
leadership and emotional intelligence in school leadership. The presentation of the
qualitative data obtained in a previous study by the author of this book (Gonzales,
2019) helps to paint a more realistic and vivid picture to advocate for greater emphasis
in strengthening the EI development of class teachers and school leaders.

Emotional Intelligence and the School
Community




15.1 Introduction

A connected school community can enhance learning opportunities for students and
support a whole-child development philosophy. It encourages shared responsibilities
and collective leadership amongst all stakeholders in the school population. To build
a compassionate and inclusive school community, school leaders and teachers need
to develop knowledge and skills to increase enhanced personal emotional intelli-
gence and collective emotional intelligence. This chapter captures research-based
approaches to inspire school leaders and teachers to strengthen their capabilities to
increase their personal emotional intelligence (EI). It also presents models and strate-
gies on how to lead collective EI to build constructive partnerships with parents and
students, and how to help students put their voices to action.



15.2 What Is a School Community?

Every school is unique with its own identity, culture, and school community. A
community is a group of people sharing common interests, social values, atti-
tudes, and responsibility to practise a common ownership. The school community
comprises students, teachers, school leaders, parents, the school board of directors
or governors, and school sponsors who directly fund the school. It also embraces
the wider community that supports the school in different ways, such as social
welfare services, teachers’ unions and teacher educators, before-and-after-school
care providers, specialist teachers who support students with additional needs, thera-
pists and educational psychologists, school health services, religious or faith groups,
student advocate groups, legal advisors and the like.
   A unified and supportive school community will help to enrich the school by

climate that reinforces its common values, culture and supportive relationships.
Historically, the term ‘community’ refers to a place or a territory, such as a neigh-
bourhood. Today, this term is also used to describe a group of people who create
social relationships amongst themselves, sharing common interests and values, and
working together to achieve common goals. A class within a school can be a small
community. Children in a class generally share common aspirations, friendships,
and collaboration. A key aspect of a community is to foster a sense of belonging,
inclusion, and respect for differences (Day, 2006; Delanty, 2003).
   Contemporary literature on school leadership is stressing the importance of
helping school principals and different levels of school leaders to develop increased
people skills and to develop their capability in parents and community engagement.
Scholars urge university and education ministries globally to provide more learning
opportunities for school leaders to enrich their collaboration and communications
skills. These skills are necessary to engage with today’s diverse school community
members. They also need to learn the skills to analyse and use multiple frames to
develop meaningful solutions to solve today’s complex problems in schools (Bryk,
2009; Capper et al., 2006; Furman, 2012; Guajardo et al., 2015).
   It is important that leaders at both school and district levels have an open mind
in understanding the different values of the diverse school community. They must
also learn to shift from a deficit mindset to an empowering one. This means they
have to stop viewing parents and community members from different backgrounds
as ‘inadequate’ and not value their input, but instead, give them a voice to express
their perspective members (Boethel, 2003; Epstein et al., 2013; Furman, 2012).



15.3 School-Community Collaboration

The term ‘school community’ also describes the social and emotional attachments
that community members may have to a school. This includes those who work in
the school, from parents and families, alumni, services and volunteers, and those
who directly or indirectly fund the school, such as sponsors and taxpayers. Growing
attention is focused on the importance of the school community and its contribution
to the whole school.
    School leaders can foster stronger parental and stakeholders’ engagement by
building trusting relationships. Many parents are uncomfortable voicing their opin-
ions or even complaining when they are seen as ‘trouble makers’ who ‘complain too
much’. They worry that their actions may negatively impact their children. School
leaders and teachers with strong EI and sensitivity towards parents’ needs are better
able to help them solve problems. One way to develop a learning community is to
run seminars and group learning sessions and invite parents to join in. School leaders
can also elicit the help of school counsellors and specialist teachers to help parents
to build the necessary skills, too. This may be done directly through having positive
and friendly dialogues with them, or refer them to support groups and parenting
networks.
15.3 School-Community Collaboration                                                   353

    Many schools in Australia excel in forming partnerships with parents and grand-
parents, for example, through helping to work in the school canteen, forming ‘busy
bees’ groups to help with environmental enhancing projects (such as starting a
vegetable garden), leading weekend environmental projects, and teaching cultural
arts and crafts as extra-curricular activities. Many parents also volunteer in helping
with reading programs, supporting young readers, and taking care of newly arrived
students from non-English speaking backgrounds. Some work collaboratively with
teachers and school staff to run monthly school newsletters to inform others on what
is happening at the school, celebrate student and staff achievement, and acknowl-
edge input from other stakeholders. They seek input from other parents by inviting
suggestions or completing surveys to identify and implement needed change. Those
who are not able to give of their time are often willing to help financially, either
by donating money, small items for school bazaars, or even finding sources to gain
sponsorships for students’ projects, small scholarships, or other revenue-generating
activities.
    Such school-community collaboration is increasingly recognised as an impor-
tant element of school success, with proof showing how such team effort is vital
in accomplishing collective goals, such as supporting families, improving student
outcomes, supporting school development and change, and most importantly, looking
after the mental health of students, staff and other parents (Anderson-Butcher et al.,
2006; Bryan & Henry, 2012; Epstein, 1995). Franklin and Streeter (1995) indicated
eight important dimensions of school-community collaborations. They are: leader-
ship skills and capability, commitment, planning, funding, resources, learning and
development, scope of change, and impact. Learning these skills does not come natu-
rally. It is a continual learning process which requires school staff, parents, and other
stakeholders to have the willingness and persistence to learn and apply them.



15.4 Building an Emotionally Intelligent School
     Community

Effective school-community partnership and collaboration depends on:
• environmental factors (the size of the school, amenities and physical facilities,
  culture of the neighbourhood),
• organisational factors (leadership and leadership capabilities, values, school
  culture, school climate), and
• individual factors (personalities, interests, different viewpoints).
It is also impacted by processes such as the school governance, collaborative coordi-
nation, and power distribution (Blank et al., 2012; Hillier et al., 2010). This highlights
the unique nature of each school and the different demands and challenges each school
community faces. Partnerships between schools and community members will help
to foster greater integration and inclusion. Through effective communication and
354                                   15 Emotional Intelligence and the School Community

exchange of suggestions and expertise, school community members can work to
create better outcomes for the students and their families.
   There is currently a growing interest in the conceptual work on group emotionality,
and the understanding of collective emotions and collective emotional competencies.
Collective emotional intelligence is defined as the ability of a group to be aware of
the affective dynamics within a group. It also includes skills to facilitate emotional
expression, and the ability to effectively regulate one’s own emotions and those of
others in a group. Authors on collective EI noted that some people are naturally high
on social awareness and sensitivity and are able to innately facilitate the coordination
of agreement in social interaction. Gifted with interpersonal attraction, these individ-
uals can influence and persuade others to concurrence. They are also highly capable
of fostering emotional bonds within a team (Walter & Brunch, 2008; Wooley et al.,
2010).
   To build a successful school, members of the school community may work as
individual teams, as well as collaboratively to plan and set goals to perpetuate school
improvement and community development. Both individual and collective EI are
key elements in building trust and forming emotional bonds with other community
members. Collective EI requires the individual to first have a good level of EI and
the ability to be emotionally self-aware. Individuals also need to have empathy and
understanding towards others, and to have the skills and capability to manage others’
emotions in stressful situations. When the majority of the group have this capacity,
they can develop collective EI. They can work towards building a collaborative
culture. Group emotions grow out of social interactions and through observing how
each behaves. When a group is able to develop a set of norms that manage emotional
expression and emotional processes, they can lift the emotional intelligence of the
group and generate positive and supportive behaviour (Druskat & Wolff, 2001a,
2001b; Goleman et al., 2002; Jordan & Troth, 2004).
   A connected school community with high collective EI cares for and supports its
members. The majority of the group is likely to have sufficient skills to ignore, dismiss
and regulate unproductive emotions of its own. Members refrain from gossiping
and spreading rumours, but instead, support each other to develop their talents and
provide each other with opportunities to learn and grow to maximise their ability
to operate at their best. When a group is high on EI, they do not raise their voice
when feeling upset or annoyed by opposing views or comments, but are able to
remain composed and listen to seek ways to solve problems raised, and to work on
them collaboratively. These are all learnable soft skills that can be developed through
individual or collective efforts (Goleman et al., 2002).



15.5 School Leadership in Building Collective EI

A school community high in collective EI shows empathy. Community leaders and
agents are sensitive to the group’s emotions and are willing and able to address unpro-
ductive emotions instead of yielding to the control of the dominant few. Effective
15.5 School Leadership in Building Collective EI                                   355

community and team leaders are competent in communication. They use knowledge-
able means and continuous learning to set and accomplish team goals, following
sound methods and focusing on the process instead of pursuing immediate deliver-
ables. They truly listen and they ask questions to gain information. They can employ
clever questioning techniques to understand others and persuade others to gain buy-
in. The skills of asking instead of telling is an important one in leading and working
in collaboration with others.
    Current literature presents evidence to show that team leaders and work supervi-
sors who are strong with EI capabilities have a direct influence on team and group
performance. They are able to manage a team’s emotions to improve performance by
inspiring them with optimism and showing support with empathy, and helping team
members to manage their own emotions while supporting others to regulate their
emotions through building confidence, trust and resilience (Kerr & Garvin, 2006;
Pescosolido, 2002; Koman & Wolff, 2008; Zhou & George, 2003). Studies have
also found that work teams that have a high level of collective EI are better able to
manage conflict and seek collaborative solutions when confronted with disagreement
and relationship tensions (Jordan & Troth, 2004; Schlaerth et al., 2013).
    To lead and create an emotionally intelligent school community, school leaders
and other community leaders need to have a repertoire of soft skills to inspire others,
move them to action, help them to resolve conflict, and deal with stressful situations
positively and productively. To do so, they need to form trusting relationships with
their teams and group members. Cook and Wall (1980) describe two dimensions of
trust in team coherence: cognitive-based trust (confidence in someone that they can
be responsible and reliable and deliver what they promise to do), and affective trust
(feelings of emotional closeness, friendship, empathy, and faith in the honourable
intentions of others). To gain and build such trusting relationships, leaders need to
be secure in their professional competence and integrity, as well as being personable
and have strong interpersonal and social skills.
    Druskat and Wolff (2001a, 2001b) believe that group behaviour is structured
through norms defined by informal rules adopted by group members, or standards set
by professional and organisational governing bodies. Members of a group or a team
bring with them a range of emotions, such as contentment, joy, anger, fear, and embar-
rassment—emotions that have unavoidable and influential effects in group settings.
Through the multi-directional interactions between and amongst group members, a
certain pattern of behaviour is formed. This is known as the group dynamic, which
affects the collective emotional structure of the group. Based upon years of research
and studies, Druskat and Wolff presented their theories on emotional intelligence
process in group EI in three dimensions of emotional intelligence, including twelve
norms of group EI behaviours described as follows:
Dimension One: Individual focus
• Group awareness of members. This describes perspective-taking and interper-
  sonal understanding (including the willingness to listen to and accept others’
  opinions).
356                                  15 Emotional Intelligence and the School Community

     Group members who have a high level of this ability are able to express their
  emotions clearly and in a positive manner, while those who don’t are unaware
  others’ emotions, and when problems occur, tend to take it personally or blame
  others.
• Group regulation of members. This is the ability to graciously confront members
  who break norms. Members with this aptitude are able to regulate their own
  emotions and also to facilitate a healthy environment and build supportive rela-
  tionships, while those who lack such skills tend to become overly emotional, are
  easily upset, and are unaware of their negative impact on their team-mates. Group
  or team leaders low on this capability also have trouble facilitating the smooth
  progress of work projects and work plans.
Dimension Two: Group focus
• Group self-awareness. This is developed through the group’s (or team’s) ability to
  self-evaluate continually and seek feedback. When group leaders are not proficient
  in helping their members to develop such group awareness, members are unable
  to build trust, are suspicious of one another, gossip and spread rumours, and work
  under negative energy.
• Group self-regulation. This is the ability to create an affirmative environment,
  proactively solve problems, and create resources to promote positive emotions.
  Group leaders with this capability are able to set their meeting agenda early to
  prepare their groups so they can bring contributing ideas to complete or plan their
  projects, make decisions, or solve problems collaboratively. Conversely, leaders
  weak in this skill often fail to motivate others, and carry out ‘pseudo’ collaboration
  (e.g., assigning tasks instead of encouraging collective input). This can result in
  group members preferring to work on their own, showing no interest in group
  meetings, and refraining from contributing to constructive involvement.
Dimension Three: Cross-boundary focus
• Group social awareness. This is the ability of individual teams to develop organ-
  isational awareness and inter-group awareness. Effective leaders inform their
  team with big-picture information and keep them abreast of organisational-wide
  knowledge.
• Group social skills. This is the ability of group members to build external rela-
  tionships. Leaders proficient in this skill are able to communicate with cross-
  functional teams. They lead in a timely manner to plan goals that align with
  organisational missions, while those lacking in these skills keep their team and
  themselves isolated and work in silos.
Studies on school leadership have produced evidence that school principals who
are good with people skills and strong on emotional intelligence are able to use
empathic listening to help teachers and school community members to engage in
more positive thinking and behaviour in communication and problem solving. They
are able to influence others in the workplace to develop higher emotional sensitivity
and positive emotional behaviour that impact an attitude change and enhance job
15.5 School Leadership in Building Collective EI                                     357

satisfaction and higher work performance. With this capacity to build a trusting bond
with the school community, these principals and school leaders can confidently create
the impetus for school change to happen successfully. (Berkovich & Eyal, 2015;
Gkolia et al., 2018; Hoxha & Hyseni-Duraku, 2017; Ozdemir & Kocak, 2018).
    School principalship is a highly demanding role. Despite the focus of current
literature still on the principal as the sole leader of a school, more scholars are advo-
cating for the practice of collective leadership and the sharing of leadership respon-
sibilities (Bolden, 2011; Crawford, 2012; Gonzales, 2019; MacBeath & Dempster,
2009; OECD, 2013). School leaders at all levels concurrently perform invisible yet
demanding emotional work day in day out. They must deal with student academic
and behavioural, social and emotional problems, parents’ demands, and societal pres-
sure. Singh et al. (2009) claimed that emotional intelligence matters twice as much
as cognitive abilities, especially in a people-oriented environment.
    Unfortunately, current literature also illustrates that leadership preparation
programs for principals and school leaders in many parts of the world still fail to
equip these leaders with the needed skills and capacity. Advocates call for a strength-
ening of the components of emotional intelligence and emotional competence as part
of leadership education and ongoing leadership development to equip them with the
mindset and capability to build a safe and harmonious emotional climate at their
school, and to lead social justice and collective emotional intelligence in the school
community (Beatty, 2006; Beatty & Brew, 2004; Leithwood, et al., 2008; Mills,
2009).
    These leadership preparation programs must strengthen school leaders’ under-
standing and sculpt leadership muscles to apply knowledge and skill in order to make
a difference in the lives of individuals, families, organisations and the whole school
community. They have to include theoretical aspects that are framed around ques-
tions of equality, ethics, social justice and practical know-how to lead collaborations
to solve today’s complex problems. They must provide leadership candidates the
opportunities with field-base opportunity to observe, participate and develop capac-
ities to work with different groups of the school community. This will enable them
to build partnership and practise using multi-perspectives to understand complex
issues to shape knowledge and skills to develop meaningful solutions (CPED, 2014;
FitzGerald & Militello, 2016; Waterston, 2015).
    As the world become more complex and diverse, leaders in any profession and
discipline face challenges that are impossible to solve alone, no matter how competent
and highly intelligent they are. By developing a higher sense of EI and bringing more
emotional intelligence to our teams and communities, we are able to foster a more
open culture of communication and empathetic camaraderie. Emotional intelligence
is about human connection. Leading collective EI is about knowing how to harness
our influence and using the right tools to improve results and affect change. We have
a young generation of hopeful leaders with potential, boundless ideals and strengths
to change the world. With necessary leadership education and development, they
can lead collective efforts to solve unsolvable problems. When the whole school
community comes together, we can nurture that collective vision to make the world
a better place, starting with our school community.
358                                   15 Emotional Intelligence and the School Community

15.6 Teachers and EI

Teaching is a profession that is fraught with intensely emotional demands. Teachers
experience a wide array of emotions day in and day out, having to deal with
student learning problems, and behavioural challenges. Their interactions with their
colleagues, other professionals in education, and sometimes irate parents, also pose
problems at times. Teachers with a high level of personal EI understand how to meet
the needs of their students leading to a more holistic way to support the learning
and development of the children and youths in their class. Studies on teachers’ EI
have produced prolific volumes of literature showing how teachers’ EI influenced
students’ learning and achievement, increased their job satisfaction, reduced stress
and burnout, and strengthened their interpersonal relationships with all the stake-
holders in the school community (e.g., Becker et al., 2014; Hargraves, 2017; Yin
et al., 2013).
    Teachers’ EI is also strongly linked with teaching efficacy, that is, teachers’ belief
in their own capacity to promote students’ engagement, maximise students’ academic
performance, and have the expertise to nurture their students’ development with a
whole-child approach. Chan (2008) found in her study that teachers with a higher
level of EI are able to manage stressors better and have stronger self-efficacy. Inter-
estingly, more recent studies have identified that young teachers, especially primary
school teachers and those who have less than six years of teaching experience, have
a stronger emotional competence in dealing with students and school-related chal-
lenges (Valente et al., 2019). Evidence also shows that teachers who have received a
higher degree, such as a master’s degree or a PhD, are also stronger in their EI and
emotional competence (Fernades, 2015; Valente, 2019). This suggests that there is
a stronger component of EI in teacher education and teacher preparation in recent
years.



15.6.1 Teachers’ Emotional Competence

Some researchers discovered that teachers working in low-income environments face
more challenges and stressful demands, having to work with fewer resources, more
challenging student behaviour, and low student achievement. For these teachers,
a higher level of EI would help them to cope with these challenges, and to help
their students to develop the necessary social and emotional knowledge and skills to
overcome familial challenges and learning difficulties (McCoy et al., 2015). Educa-
tion authors maintain that teachers with underdeveloped EI will struggle to meet
the complex demands in today’s schools, and they advocate for increased attention
in helping teachers to develop their emotional intelligence and relevant emotional
competence (Holzberger et al., 2013; Lancaster, 2014).
15.6 Teachers and EI                                                               359

  The 1997 Bar-on Emotional Intelligence model (2006) appears to be more
popular (amongst other EI models) in education and in the development of teachers’
emotional competence.
  The model comprises five main categories and sub-categories of EI:
1.   Intrapersonal EI (self-awareness and self-expression)
     •   Self-regard: to know and understand oneself
     •   Emotional self-awareness: to perceive and understand one’s own emotions
     •   Assertiveness: to express one’s emotions positively and effectively
     •   Independence: to be free from emotional dependence on others
     •   Self-actualisation: to endeavour to do one’s best to achieve personal goals
         and to develop one’s potential
2.   Interpersonal EI (social awareness and interpersonal relationships)
     • Empathy: to be aware of and understand how others feel
     • Social responsibility: to cooperate with others and to identify with social
       groups to whom they belong
     • Interpersonal relationships: to have the ability to relate well with others and
       to establish healthy relationships and friendships with others
3.   Stress management (emotional management and regulation)
     • Stress tolerance: to be able to manage one’s emotions in stressful times
     • Impulse control: to be able to regulate one’s reactions and behaviour, even
       when faced with pressure or stress; to know how to think before acting
4.   Adaptability (change management)
     • Reality-testing: to objectively validate one’s feelings and thoughts with
       external reality
     • Flexibility: to be able to adapt and adjust one’s feelings and think of new
       ways to cope with situational demands
     • Problem-solving: to effectively solve problems without being emotional
5.   General Mood (self-motivation)
     • Optimism: to develop a positive mindset and look at the bright side when
       faced with difficulties
     • Happiness: to feel content with oneself, with others, and with life in general.
Scholars all over the world are urging universities and teacher education providers
to invest more time and effort in increasing teachers’ EI and emotional capacities to
cope with their own needs, and to teach and help students to develop their emotional
intelligence. They stress the importance of personalising these learning opportunities,
and not just provide online training and grant them a certificate of completion after
two or three hours of learning. To help teachers to develop EI and related skills, they
must be supported with ongoing development opportunities. These include oppor-
tunities to have professional dialogues with specialists or experts on the subject, to
360                                   15 Emotional Intelligence and the School Community

observe others and see how they utilise their EI and skills to build relationships and
solve problems, to equip them with practicable strategies in the classroom and in the
school environment and, if possible, provide them with personalised mentoring or
coaching (Dolev & Leshem, 2017a, 2017b; Hassan et al., 2015; Ju et al., 2015; Patel,
2017; Thakur, 2012; Vesely et al., 2017).



15.6.2 Supporting Teachers in Conflict Management

Constructive conflict management is vital in the school environment. Yet it remains
one of teachers’ major concerns as many do not believe they have the capacity to
handle conflict effectively (Rimm-Kaufman et al., 2005). Many researchers concep-
tualised conflict as neutral and should not be viewed as something negative nor to
avoid (King et al., 2009; Rahim, 2011). For example, Putnam and Poole (1987)
described conflict as ‘the interaction of interdependent people who perceive opposi-
tion of goals, aims, and values, and see the opposing party as potentially interfering
with the realisations of these goals’ (p. 552). Some authors see conflicts as ‘construc-
tive controversy’ and claimed that, when perceived positively and handled with skill,
they will lead to positive outcomes, like higher task accomplishment, increased job
satisfaction, and greater future cooperation (De Dreu & Gelfanc, 2008; Tjosvold
et al., 2003).
    Teachers and school leaders face conflicts in the form of complaints on a daily
basis. Education ministries and school governance bodies worldwide have set policies
and procedures to guide school staff on how to handle complaints and conflict within
the school environment. Teachers should be aware of these policies and procedures.
They can also seek support from their supervisors and senior management to help
them to solve these challenges. For example, the Department of Education and Early
Childhood Development of Victoria, Australia, has produced a very comprehensive
policy guide for the public school system (2009). In this policy booklet, guidelines
are set out to help teachers to develop EI competence to handle conflict and manage
relationships in the school environment. Readers may find the following summary
helpful.
1.    Building positive relationships
      Positive relationships are built upon mutual respect. Communication is key to
      all healthy relationships. Teachers must learn to communicate effectively and
      engage in active listening to understand and appreciate parents’ perspectives.
      Highlight the positive things that the school can do to address parents’ concerns
      and invite them to set common goals to facilitate a better outcome.
2.    Dealing with a complainant
      Teachers and school leaders need to value complaints and not perceive them
      as totally negative. Complaints are an important way for the community to
      communicate with a school. Complaints provide valuable feedback about the
      teacher and how the school is performing to meet the needs of the students and
15.6 Teachers and EI                                                                361

     the parents concerned. When the complainant’s emotional investment is high,
     the complaint can come across as a demand. Listen to the complainant carefully
     and with an open mind and treat them with respect. Take notes and do not be in a
     defensive mode. Show the complainant that you are there to help and not to fight
     them. Keep the discussion on relevant issues, check facts, check assumptions,
     and refrain from forming an opinion before hearing all sides of the story. Seek
     support from your supervisor, the principal, or refer to policy guidelines if in
     doubt. Follow-up actions are important, especially if it is a complex issue. Keep
     lines of communication open and make sure that written responses address all
     of the issues and are written in easy-to-read language.
3.   Active listening
     Even if the complainant is very emotional, teachers and school leaders should be
     patient and really listen. Allow silence in the conversation. Never be defensive.
     Be mindful of your tone of voice and body language. A friendly nod and a
     welcoming body posture may calm the complainant and lead them to shift their
     attitude, and be more willing to listen and engage in a more positive conversation.
     Be genuine when listening, and acknowledge the person’s feelings.
4.   Being assertive: saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ with confidence
     Some people have problems saying ‘no’ because they may think it is selfish or
     uncaring to do so, or try to avoid confrontations, or just simply don’t know how
     to do it effectively. Teachers need to develop assertive skills to handle parents
     who make unreasonable demands. Be sure to give a reason for refusing the
     request by explaining the facts and rationale for the decision. Offer alternatives
     if you can think of any. Ask for more time to consider the request and discuss
     the matter with your supervisor if you are not sure about what to do.
5.   Understanding the blame cycle
     Being under extreme pressure can make a person angry, judgemental, fearful,
     self-righteous or revengeful. They might find themself believing that other
     people have bad intentions or lack ability, and wanting to blame (and punish)
     anyone and everything. Blaming might appeal as a quick fix, but it creates bad
     feelings, undermines everyone’s willingness to work together, and can perpet-
     uate difficulties rather than address them. Understand that many parents are not
     trained in handling their emotions and they may need to blame someone or
     something to hide their sense of guilt and their sense of failure to meet their
     responsibility. Learn the art of deflecting blame and, most importantly, do not
     blame the complainant, even if they are really at fault.
6.   Managing a request for an apology
     Parents who make a complaint may ask for an apology. If both parties recog-
     nise each other’s rights and responsibilities and want a ‘win-win’ outcome,
     an apology alone may resolve the complaint. Where it does not, it can reduce
     tension and pave the way for maintaining and repairing relationships. However,
     if the apology is given in a way that results in the recipient seeing it as a
     defeat, the apology can backfire and escalate a conflict. If a teacher does not
     feel she is in the wrong and needs to make an apology, she can still maintain
     a good relationship by stating how she feels, e.g., “I understand that you are
362                                   15 Emotional Intelligence and the School Community

      angry/upset because...”, in other words, state the negative impact of the cause of
      the complaint. “You are concerned because it...Let’s move on and find a better
      way forward”. If the complainant is still upset, schedule another meeting and
      seek advice from someone who can support you.
7.    Moving beyond a stalemate
      Sometimes a matter of concern may drag on without reaching a mutually desired
      resolution. Parties concerned need to focus on the problem and not the persons
      and refrain from blaming and gossiping. Go through the record and see if the
      same solution has been tried repeatedly. Explore barriers to further discuss
      alternative ways to move on. Address emotions and seek help and advice from
      other members of the school community or from external professional experts.
      Encourage fair play in negotiations.
8.    Managing aggressive reactions
      When the complainant is aggressive, you must stay calm yourself. If possible,
      offer a glass of water. This can also buy time for the complainant to calm
      down. If possible, bring in another person (your supervisor or a colleague).
      Acknowledge the complainant’s concerns. Do not argue or defend. Ask open
      questions, such as “What would we need to do to address this matter? (e.g.,
      to improve communication, to help your child?). It is helpful to follow up with
      a letter (or email) or keep in touch with the complainant to see if the solution
      worked, and decide if further interactions are required, or if further steps are
      needed to address the issue.
9.    Managing unreasonable confrontation
      Acknowledge the complainant’s concerns but at the same time, assert the
      school’s position and policies. If, after investigating the complaint, there is
      nothing further you can do, and no resolution or mutually agreed remedy has
      been reached, teachers and school leaders may need to send the complaint to
      the regional office in line with departmental policy. Where appropriate, make
      it clear that there will be no further correspondence or contact with the school
      about the complaint. Communicate clearly, keep records of meetings and take
      notes.
Conflict management and conflict resolutions are specific skills. Teachers need
training and practice to develop such tactics and capabilities. No one can achieve all
these skills and competence by simply reading about them. They need to observe
how other people do it and practise by role playing with a buddy or a colleague.
We learn better through experience and even mistakes. Like building our muscles
through physical training, we can build our emotional intelligence through being
mindful at being self-aware, understanding our emotions and effectively managing
our emotional reactions. We need to put effort into developing positive behaviour and
unlearning old, unhelpful habits, learning to be sensitive to others, showing empathy,
and having the genuine desire to build healthy and mutually supportive relationships
with others.

15.7 Parent-School Partnership

There is no shortage of literary works on the value of parental input in students’ overall
development and school success. When parents form partnerships with teachers and
the school community, visible benefits are noted, such as reduced absenteeism and
truancy, improvement in students’ conduct, attitude toward school, self-esteem and
motivation, and increased effect in academic achievement (Dearing et al., 2006;
Hill & Tyson, 2009; Wairimu et al., 2016).
    Parental involvement is broadly articulated as an important aspect of children’s
educational success worldwide. Good parenting at home is considered one of the most
important factors that impact a child’s educational attainment, and the overall devel-
opment of the child. However, parental expectations vary in different cultures. For
example, parents in Eastern cultures, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, gener-
ally believe that teachers and school leaders are trained professionals who know what
is best for the education of their children and tend to refrain from ‘interfering’ with
the school process. They have high regard for teachers and school personnel. Many
Asian parents support their children with home-based intervention, such as helping
them with homework and revision, engaging tutoring to encourage supplementary
learning, enrolling their children in art, music and sports classes to develop their
social and extra-curricular interest after school. Likewise, some teachers in Asian
countries generally do not welcome parental input and sometimes view their sugges-
tions and feedback as complaints (Gu & Yawkey, 2009). On the other hand, parents
in Western culture believe that children learn and grow at home, at school, and in
their communities (Daniel, 2011). They understand that home support from parents
is not sufficient for effective learning to take place and are happy to contribute their
time and effort in partnership with teachers and the school community to support a
whole-child development.



15.7.1 Barriers in Parental Involvement

Amongst the many barriers described in the literature that deter parents’ engage-
ment in the school community, three common themes surfaced: culture and identity,
communication barriers, and organisational barriers.

Cultural and identity barriers
Parents from non-Western culture do not share the concept of parental input at school
and generally do not expect to be involved in such participation. They show very low
efficacy as ‘partners’ who can work side-by-side with a teacher. Furthermore, these
parents will not ‘interfere’ unless they are invited to take part in activities instigated by
school personnel and other members of the school community. Additionally, there
are other psychological factors that influence parents’ hesitation to participate in
school intervention and to help their children at the school level. This includes their
364                                  15 Emotional Intelligence and the School Community

language skills, their education levels, work commitments, and their socio-economic
status (Giallo et al., 2013; Green et al., 2007; Walker et al., 2005).
    Studies have found that teachers who are culturally sensitive are better able to
form partnerships with parents who are not familiar with this idea. Some parents
may learn through their children’s school experience and form an awareness of a
cultural distance when they perceive social-cultural differences (language, dress,
faith and values) and discrimination. This will lead to a reluctance to show up at
school ‘unnecessarily’ or to avoid social contact with ‘unfriendly’ members of the
school community. Teachers with an open mind and willingness to understand and
accommodate these parents’ concerns are able to help nervous parents feel safe
and build their confidence in supporting their children in accordance with school
expectations.

Communication barriers
Communication barriers stretch beyond spoken and written language. Many schools
are able to employ translators to help with written communication or enlist the help
of other bi-lingual parents to serve as interpreters in face-to-face meetings with
parents. Communication barriers can exist even between people who speak the same
language. These include perceptual barriers and emotional barriers.
   We form unconscious bias toward someone that we do not know well, or someone
very different from us. This is deeply rooted in our culture and upbringing. This
preconceived judgement or bias will affect how we communicate with others, and
create perceptual barriers. When we are self-aware and other-aware, we will learn
to ditch our preconceived assumptions about others, and replace judgement with
curiosity by learning to ask questions tactfully to build rapport and establish trust.
Similarly, we create barriers of communication when we are emotionally charged. It is
therefore important to be mindful of our emotional state when we communicate with
others. This is especially vital when engaging in a sensitive and tricky conversation.
Genuine authentic communication happens when we listen in order to understand,
and not to respond or defend.

Organisational barriers
Some studies found that parents’ enthusiasm in school involvement is often damp-
ened by organisation barriers, such as the lack of understanding of how to get involved
and what they are expected to do, feelings of marginalisation due to their socio-
economic status, confusion about the school operation structures, untrained staff
who are not friendly or even discriminatory in their manners and language, and the
aloofness of school leaders (Byrd, 2011; Yoder & Lopez, 2013). Despite increasing
awareness of the importance of engaging parents as partners in the education of
the students, more needs to be done to support school leaders and staff to develop
attitudes, skills and capacity to put such an ideal into practice.
15.7 Parent-School Partnership                                                     365

15.7.2 Supportive Structures to Enhance Parent-School
       Partnership

Parent-school partnerships are based on mutual respect, trust and collaboration. Lead-
ership is critical in establishing, maintaining and revitalising partnerships. Mapp &
Kuttner introduced a Dual Capacity-Building Framework for Family-School Partner-
ships (2013), which is now widely adopted and practised worldwide. The framework
outlines five key principles:
•    Build relationships with families before plunging into program work
•    Collaborate in order to get to know students’ needs, passions, and knowledge
•    Work together and make projects interactive
•    Provide support to develop families’ capacities to assist their children
•    Link it all to learning. Focus conversations on academic content and strategies,
     rather than rules and expectations
To strengthen parent-school partnerships, school leaders need to create conditions
which are conducive to enhancing and promoting positive and effective relation-
ships, and for such partnerships to be sustainable. Some schools put action groups
in place to plan, organise, implement, and evaluate parent engagement activities.
Today, many schools in the western world (e.g., the U.S., Canada, Australia) are
guided by governmental guidelines with policies and procedures which explicitly
state principles and strategies of how to establish and maintain effective parent-
school partnerships. There are also support networks to enable school communi-
ties to discuss issues, share ideas and best practice, report on successes, and drive
continuous improvement in partnerships.



15.7.3 Key Elements in Successful Parent-School Partnership

Mapp and Kuttner (2013) also point out two essential conditions which are
vital to parent-school partnership success. They include process conditions, and
organisational conditions.

Process conditions
1.    Processes should be relational and built on mutual trust
      Teachers who are under-developed with their skills to work with parents as
      partners may make inaccurate and unhelpful assumptions about students and
      their families. Education leaders (education ministers and school directors) must
      ensure that teachers and staff understand the importance of establishing trusting
      relationships with others and provide learning and development opportunities to
      build their capacity. They also need to develop relational strategies to enhance
      amicable interaction between school staff and parents to encourage more active
366                                   15 Emotional Intelligence and the School Community

      participation from parents with different activities to support their children’s
      education.
2.    Processes should be connected to student learning and development
      Mapp and Kuttner (2013) noted that many schools involve their parents mostly
      in social activities and miss the opportunity to engage them in sharing the respon-
      sibility of supporting their children’s cognitive, emotional, physical and social
      development. The authors feel that schools should create more opportunities
      to inform parents about their curriculum, instructional practices and academic
      goals for different student groups. Parents would benefit if the school invited
      them to attend learning and development days to discuss such plans and policies
      and provide opportunities for parents to run workshops or meetings to discuss
      other social issues, such as how to deal with bullying, preventing substance
      abuse, establishing relationships with their teens, and programs that help parents
      develop skills they need.
3.    Processes should be asset-based
      Mapp and Kuttner (2013) also remind school leaders and teachers to adopt
      a positive view and drop the traditional ‘deficit-based’ mindset of focusing
      only on the shortcomings or deficiencies of the students. Instead of discussing
      why students are ‘lazy’, ‘unmotivated’, or ‘misbehaving’, teachers should focus
      on the existing strengths and necessary strengths of these students and work
      with their parents to develop their potential. They call this an ‘asset-based’ or
      ‘strength-based’ approach to identify the strengths and interests of the students
      and build their potential as a strategy to solve learning and behavioural problems.
4.    Processes should be culturally responsive and respectful
      Culturally responsive engagement requires all school community members to
      be respectful and responsive to cultural differences and refrain from unhelpful
      and discriminatory attitudes and behaviour. This applies not only to racial differ-
      ences but also to religious and generational differences, gender and sexual iden-
      tity, students with disabilities, students with refugee status or backgrounds, and
      students with unconventional family combinations. We live in a world very
      different from a couple of decades ago when we were students ourselves. It is
      necessary to have an open mind and embrace the diverse needs of our students
      and their families.
5.    Processes should be collaborative
      Leaders need to build their school’s capacity to work collaboratively, enabling
      teachers and parents to work together and learn from one another. By offering
      program specifics to meet the needs of their parent group, the school can enhance
      a joint effort that ultimately impacts positive developmental, social, and educa-
      tional outcomes for their students. Through collaboration, the school community
      can build supportive social networks and develop a stronger social capital for
      their community.
6.    Processes should be interactive
      Mapp and Kuttner (2013) assert that parent-school partnerships need to be inter-
      active, with both parties learning from each other. They would work best if there
      were feedback mechanisms put in place to monitor progress and to identify
15.7 Parent-School Partnership                                                       367

      problems so that improvements can be made. The school should also provide
      opportunities for parent engagement with a developmental orientation (to help
      parents build skills and knowledge and learn how to solve problems) and a
      service orientation (to provide services and support for those who need help).
     Organisational conditions
1.    to build systemic family-school partnerships
      Parent-school partnerships and parental engagement needs to be a long-term
      strategic goal in the school annual plan and be evaluated and revised annually.
      It should be embraced by leadership across the organisation.
2.    to enhance integrated family-school partnerships
      The practice of parental engagement should no longer be an optional practice. It
      needs to be embedded into the structures and processes in the professional devel-
      opment of teachers and school leaders and integrated into the job description of
      the teaching profession.
3.    to establish sustainable family-school partnerships
      Parental engagement and parent-school partnerships need to become part of the
      school’s infrastructure, with funding to support such practices, and policies and
      procedures to guide their implementation and performance.
To sum up, school leaders who are able to develop their capability to utilise the human
capital of parents’ skills and knowledge, to harness the social capital of the school
community to build relationships and support networks, and to nurture and develop a
collaborative school community, life will change for the better for the whole school
community. It will take time and a lot of hard work, but it will happen. Where there
is a will, there is a way. Believe and achieve.



15.8 The School Community and Student Leadership

Students are the key component of a school community. Sadly, many students across
the world still feel a low level of belonging in their school and their school community.
To promote a stronger sense of students’ connectedness with their school, we must
give them a voice and listen to their needs. The term ‘student voice’ has become a buzz
word in education literature, describing active student engagement and participation
in issues that are important for their learning, growth and development. A school that
values student voice listens to their students to understand the different aspects of
their school life as feedback for planning and decision-making in their school goals
and strategies. Student voice in the classroom creates consistent opportunities for
feedback and reflection from which teachers can learn so that they can improve their
pedagogy and relationship with their students. Student voice in the school community
provides ways for students to realise their interests and talents and develop real-life
skills and experience that will enhance their whole-person development.
    Traditionally, students have had no voice in any part of school decisions. The
growing movement in promoting student voice actually began as early as the 1960s
368                                  15 Emotional Intelligence and the School Community

and -70s. This philosophical shift encourages the whole school community to
embrace the belief that everyone plays a part in contributing to the common good
of the school, and student voice should be heard and valued. Education leadership
scholars noted that the absence of a student voice has resulted in chronic absenteeism,
disruptive behaviour, poor academic achievement, increased bullying, aggression
and violence in the school, and a high drop-out rate (Fullan, 1991; Kozol, 1991;
Liberman & Miller, 1990; Smyth, 2006). Haller and Strike (1986) proposed the
inclusion of student voice in school decisions to give them a choice in their learning
options. Fullan (1991) asked, “what would happen if we treated students as someone
whose opinion mattered?”(p. 170). And Cook-Sather (2007) urged school leaders
not to treat students as consumers of products but co-makers of the product, given an
equal role in planning their learning and contributing to the development of school
policies and curriculum programs.
   Globally, scholars have produced evidence to prove the importance of student
voice. Rudduck et al. (1997) in the UK have given testimony that student voice
impacts positive educational change. In Canada, Pekrul and Levin (2005) found
that democratic student voice can impact a mass shift in school cultural change. In
Denmark, the government values student voice as a driving force to revitalise the
positive energies in creating democratic schools (Flutter, 2007). And in the U.S.,
Mitra (2004) found that when school leaders listen to their student voice, they are
better able to understand why students struggle in their learning and social adjust-
ments, pointing to blind spots that adults missed. The promotion of student voice
has been linked to elevated learning achievement, increased classroom participation,
enhanced school reform, fewer behavioural problems and enhanced self-reflection
for both students and teachers in teaching and learning.



15.8.1 Why Is Student Voice Important?

The student achievement gaps in education are getting wider across the world. In
the U.S., the high drop-out rate in high schools is prevalent, especially amongst
students of colour and minority groups, and those living in poverty and low socio-
economic areas (Smyth, 2006; Steinberg & McCray, 2012). Students are disengaged
because their primary human needs are not met. They feel powerless, inadequate, and
hopeless. Likewise, other groups of students who have additional support needs are
not given the help and understanding to build their self-esteem and self-confidence.
Scholars are pleading with education policy makers and school leaders to respond
to the complex interplay of factors that marginalise students, and truly listen to their
voices (e.g. Brenner-Camp, 2011).
    Emotionally intelligent school leaders value student voice and are compassionate.
Evidence has been found to prove that when students are heard and feel valued, they
change for the better. Such evidence was given by Yaffe (2018) who found that black
male teens showed marked improvement in their academic achievement when their
teachers were able to show empathy and understand their problems, supporting them
15.8 The School Community and Student Leadership                                  369

with strategies to help them learn and grow. Stelmach et al. (2017) also gave evidence
on how Canadian teachers with high levels of empathy and compassion helped their
aboriginal students to enjoy school better, reduced the absenteeism rate and increased
school attendance. Other scholars also proved that when teachers are more caring and
amicable, and are sensitive to the emotional needs of their students, they are able to
create a friendly environment to strengthen students’ sense of belonging and increase
their self-esteem. These teachers are able to help their students to build friendships
and establish peer support groups, leading to increased school success and student
satisfaction with their school lives (Berk, 2012; Gallardo et al., 2016).
   American educational psychologists Eric Tsahalis and Michael Nakkula point
out the importance of teachers’ awareness and understanding of student engagement
(2012). They have introduced a spectrum to help teachers to involve students’ input
through listening to them and developing practical strategies to put their student
voice into feasible teaching and learning approaches. The spectrum ranges from
expression, consultation, participation, partnership, and activism to leadership.
• Expression: Expression gives students the opportunity to express their opin-
  ions, complaints, praises, and objections. Additionally, teachers learn from their
  students’ study attitude, school work presentation, and test scores to gather infor-
  mation to evaluate teaching effectiveness, and to understand students’ challenges,
  difficulties and relational issues.
• Consultation: Consultation actively asks students for feedback and suggestions.
  Even surveys and focus group research can be conducted to gain students’
  perspectives on their learning.
• Participation: Participation involves students in planning and decision making
  in curriculum programs and projects, and gives suggestions on how these can best
  be implemented and evaluated.
• Partnership: This encourages and provides students with opportunities to take
  a lead role in identifying issues that need attention, and to work collaboratively
  with them to decide how best to address them.
• Activism: Activism encourages students to be proactive and aware of issues other
  than learning and academic matters. It teaches them to advocate for what they
  value with integrity, honesty, and respect.
• Student leadership: This helps students to develop leadership skills and provide
  them with opportunities to learn and exercise these skills. Student leadership can
  be developed in formal and informal situations, such as through recreational clubs,
  and sports and art clubs. Students can take part in academic- and subject-related
  leadership roles, as well as social and citizenship development.


15.8.2 Student Leadership: Putting Voice into Action

Genuine response to student voice by hearing and using their ideas and suggestions
will help students increase their motivation to learn and overcome challenges they
meet at school. School leaders and teachers can further drive meaningful student
370                                  15 Emotional Intelligence and the School Community

engagement by giving them opportunities to lead initiatives and to develop student
leadership. They can partner with students and regard them as critical stakeholders,
and also embrace their capacities for creative and innovative ideas to solve problems
from a young person’s perspective. Students can develop their intrapersonal and
interpersonal intelligences and competence to face a complex and fast-changing
world. School leaders and teachers can help them to develop adaptability, flexibility
and resilience.
   Having the opportunity to take on a student leadership role is hugely benefi-
cial for young people. First of all, they will learn about self-awareness and gain
a better understanding of their strengths and limitations. They will increase their
self-confidence through delivering speeches to their fellow students or speaking to
adults on their behalf. Through working with teachers and other school commu-
nity members, they will develop better social, management, and organisation skills.
Through collaborative involvement, young people will learn how to work through
others and with others. They will learn about responsibility and accountability. By
helping their fellow students, they will learn to understand others with empathy,
develop active listening skills, inspire others and learn how to respond to other
students with opposing views (Lavery & Hine, 2013; Neumann et al., 2009).
   Being a student leader is not about glory. It is about service and learning how
to be humble. It is about mobilising action with persuasion, developing negotiation
skills to achieve goals, and dealing with defeat and disappointment. Student leaders
will learn to set realistic goals and expectations and, in the process, learn to deal
with intense emotions and self-conflict. Sometimes, through painful experiences and
hurt feelings, they will learn how to balance criticism and praise, to ignore spiteful
gossip, and to consistently strive to be bold, fair, and work with integrity. When
young individuals can weather all these challenges in their adolescence, imagine
what outstanding adults they will become.



15.8.3 How to Support Student Leadership

Currently, schools worldwide are providing leadership opportunities for their
students, even in senior primary school years. However, school leaders and teachers
need to be aware that these leadership opportunities are not tokenistic, such as
merely announcing school events in school assemblies and addressing parades.
Apart from offering opportunities for them to be class captains, prefects, club chairs,
sports captains, and school council representatives, school can support leadership
development through offering appropriate leadership development programs. School
leaders and teachers can also involve students in adult-own and youth-led engage-
ment, bearing in mind that, while the responsibility belongs to the students, the
accountability rests with the teachers and school leaders.
15.9 Conclusion                                                                                 371

15.9 Conclusion

The growing complexity of today’s school environment compels us to find creative
solutions for a kaleidoscope of demands and challenges. This requires us as educators
and parents to develop a wider breadth of skills rooted in academic and professional
competencies, people skills, critical thinking, emotional intelligence and compe-
tence, and a growth mindset. These skills are all interconnected. Challenging as they
seem, they encourage us to be agile thinkers and learners who are willing and able
to adapt, to work together as collective teams, and to lead necessary change. To lead
and prepare our next generation to establish their self-identity, and a sense of agency
and purpose, we need to support them to be more curious, compassionate, innovative
and creative, and have the courage to stand up for human integrity and social justice.
We need to put our cognitive, social and emotional resources into action. To achieve
this, we need to be their role models and lead by example.
   Life is exciting!

Helping Students to Develop Emotional
Intelligence




16.1 Introduction

Young people go through extreme ups and downs at different stages of their lives,
especially during puberty. Without proper support and guidance, some children and
adolescents can find it hard to understand why they have unhelpful responses to
their emotional reactions. This chapter discusses the importance of teacher effi-
cacy in helping students to develop emotional competencies through school Social
Emotional Learning (SEL) programs. It presents research-based approaches that can
help teachers to prevent and resolve conflicts at school and in the classroom. It draws
on research data to illustrate how successful schools have focused effort on leading
SEL in their schools and districts, and presents current EI programs and learning
software that have been found to be effective in enhancing SEL at school in different
parts of the world.
    EI provides students with the knowledge and skills to make sound decisions
and good choices. It gives them tools with which to solve problems and develop
moral values, become empathic and friendly, and take responsibility for their actions.
Educators and government policy-makers are recognising the importance of EI in
school education, and in the last decade, more schools and teachers have been working
collaboratively to plan and implement SEL in schools all over the world.
    Many youth problems stem from low self-esteem and the absence of an idyllic
childhood. This can be exacerbated by adults (parents and/or teachers) who, instead of
understanding children’s emotional needs, spend most of the time telling them what
they’ve done wrong. Given this string of disappointments and failures to meet expec-
tations, young people can develop a pervading sense of being ‘not good enough’.
When parents and teachers are skilled in EI, though, they can be more sensitive to
the needs of young people with low self-esteem and help them to shed their negative
emotional conditioning in a respectful, careful and gentle way.
    Currently, teachers and educators are coached to utilise a strength-based approach
to help students to build self-confidence and self-esteem. They are reminded to look
for opportunities to compliment and support students’ existing strengths instead

of focusing on their problems or limitations. This does not mean accommodating
bad behaviour or accepting low-quality work; it means helping students using a
more positive mindset and focusing on how to increase their ability to grow by first
attending to the emotional side of learning.
   The strength-based approach to teaching and learning requires teachers to engage
in reflective thinking and practice, and to develop a critical understanding of their
own pedagogy— how they relate to their students, and how this impacts the students’
learning and development. It also requires teachers to be inclusive, and focus not
only on academic achievement but also on helping students to tackle learning diffi-
culties. Finally, it requires teachers to create opportunities for students to express
their thoughts and feelings by actively influencing what happens in the classrooms
and on the school playground.
   Teaching is a challenging and demanding profession. Being an effective teacher
takes patience, passion, dedication and continuous learning and self-development.
This is why teachers need to have strong EI—so that they will be able to understand
and manage both their own emotions and those of the people around them. They
need strong interpersonal skills and communication skills to connect with students
and members of the school community. They need to have genuine collaborative
skills so that they can work with their colleagues and other professionals to solve
complex student problems. And they need caring support from their colleagues and
supervisors, and a strong belief in themselves, to be able to make a difference in the
lives of their students and fulfil the vocational mission they have chosen.



16.2 Teacher Efficacy in Facilitating SEL in School
     Education

There is growing evidence that emotional competence is a vital part of teaching.
Teachers with high EI and emotional competencies are better able to pay attention
to the emotional aspects of classroom learning and to create a conducive atmosphere
for learning. They are also able to empathise and respond appropriately to others’
emotions, and show a greater ability to enhance student engagement, leading to higher
learning achievement (Chesnut & Burley, 2015; Wu, 2013; Yoke & Panatik, 2015).
With the increased attention on enhancing SEL in schools, many teachers feel they
need more learning and development to strengthen their efficacy in fostering SEL
in their daily practice. Researchers also stressed the importance of understanding
the personal EI of teachers and whether they are adequately prepared during their
pre-service teacher education (Turner & Stough, 2019).
    In a recent study, Gallardo et al. (2019) interviewed 624 first- and fourth-year
students studying for Bachelor of Education degrees at various Australian universities
to understand their perceptions of EI’s role in education. When asked to describe what
EI meant to them, over 30% gave the following replies:
16.2 Teacher Efficacy in Facilitating SEL in School Education                      379

•    the understanding of emotions (self and others).
•    the ability to control and manage emotions.
•    the ability to empathise.
•    the awareness of one’s own emotions and behaviour, and those of others.
•    the ability to communicate and interact with others.
•    the ability to express emotions appropriately.
Their most common responses to the question on how important EI was to them as
future teachers were that it was important:
• for classroom management.
• to deliver wellbeing programs.
• for making decisions about curriculum content.
Participants were also asked to describe what they thought were the most effective
modes of delivery in teacher education. Their responses were, in order of preference:
•    lectures/tutorials/learning units.
•    examples and real-life teaching.
•    practical training and activities.
•    interaction with other teachers and students.
Additionally, about 10–12% of the participants responded that they were not sure,
and over 16% expressed a need to strengthen the SEL elements to build stronger
efficacy.
    In another study, in 2017, Loinaz surveyed and interviewed 750 teachers from
Greece, Spain, England and Sweden to understand their perceptions of SEL (which
in Europe is known as Social Emotional Education or SEE). The study focused on
three main themes: (1) The purpose of SEE; (2) How it helps teachers to fulfil their
responsibilities; and (3) How it prepares students for the future. Below is a summary
of the key findings:
1.    What is the purpose of SEE?

        – It improves the pro-social growth of society by teaching students how to

          social society.
While there were some cultural differences identified among the four European coun-
tries surveyed, teachers mostly shared a common perception of their self-awareness,
and similar reflections on their own emotions at work and their roles and responsi-
bilities in planning and implementing SEE to assist their students’ holistic personal
development throughout the different stages of their life journey. Scholars from
other parts of the world also advocate gaining a broader and deeper understanding
of teachers’ needs and developing professional education content and approaches
to help teachers strengthen their efficacy in planning and implementing SEL/SEE
in school education. Many suggested applying a longitudinal research approach to
gain greater insights and provide more helpful suggestions for teacher development
(Darby et al., 2011; Darling-Hammond, 2010; Schonert-Reichl, 2017).
16.2 Teacher Efficacy in Facilitating SEL in School Education                       383

16.2.1 Classroom Conflicts

Episodes of conflict take place in schools on a daily basis. These may be due to
minor disagreements or differences in interests, values and needs, or misunderstand-
ings. They appear in the form of arguments, exchanges of verbal abuse and offensive
language, disrespectful comments, classroom disruptions, destruction of school prop-
erty, and even acts of aggression and violence. Common classroom conflicts include
student–student disputes and student–teacher tensions or even power struggles in the
classroom. EI plays a vital role in helping teachers manage job-related stress and
handle stressful teaching conditions positively.
    Teachers are role models for their students. EI is a vital component of teaching and
learning, because when teachers have high EI, they are able to articulate, identify, and
understand their own emotional processes and those of their students in the classroom,
thus improving interpersonal relationships and establishing positive student–teacher
bonds. Studies have found that teachers who are able to perceive and identify the
emotions of their students during class time are more effective in regulating emotions
in the classroom. They are able to read students’ emotions from non-verbal cues and
monitor the pace of their teaching to minimise boredom, reduce anxiety for those who
struggle to catch up and motivate thinking and action. They are also able to create a
caring and nurturing emotional classroom climate that is conducive to collaborative
learning (Brackett et al., 2010; Meyer & Turner, 2007).
    We all learn from our role models—our parents, our current and former teachers
and our colleagues. At the moment, many teachers still resort to old-school domi-
nating or even coercive strategies for solving student–teacher conflict. However, there
are numerous papers in the education literature on teacher stress and burnout, and
some scholars highlight the need to strengthen teachers’ capability to understand
and handle conflict to avoid these. One of the major gaps in teachers’ abilities to
handle student–teacher conflicts is their inability to perceive students’ emotional
needs, which then translate into behavioural challenges (Hopkins & Yonker, 2015;
Rispens & Demerouti, 2016).
    It is therefore vital that teachers become proficient in resolving problems using
a high level of EI. In the twenty-first century school context, conflicts with students
have become progressively more complex. Teachers need a wide repertoire of skills
and capabilities to adapt their practices to handle that complexity. They also need such
capabilities to become role models who promote social and emotional competencies
and demonstrate pro-social behaviours. However, the literature continues to highlight
that teachers have difficulties in handling conflict management constructively without
affecting their relationships with students due to a lack of key skills and preparation
(e.g. Doğan, 2016; Özgan, 2016).
384                                                     16 Helping Students to Develop …

16.2.2 Effective Conflict Management Strategies

There are numerous models of effective conflict management used in the corporate
realm. One of these, which is also one of the models most employed in educa-
tion settings, was developed by Rahim et al. (2002). These professional advisers on
conflict management viewed conflict as a two-dimensional motivation orientation: a
self-interest orientation and a solution-focused orientation. They observed that people
who use a dominating style of conflict resolution seek to achieve a self-interest goal,
and in the process neglect others’ interests and emotional needs.
   Rahim et al. (2002) identified five common strategies that people use to
handle conflicts. They are: integrating, obliging, compromising, dominating and
avoiding.
• Integrating: This style of conflict management requires open and honest discus-
  sion and active listening to understand each other’s concerns and discontentment.
  It uses a collaborative approach to find common ground and involves both parties
  (and other supportive parties) in finding a solution with a win–win outcome.
  Teachers who used this strategy reason with students inside or outside of the class-
  room setting, and involve students and/or other people concerned (parents, other
  teachers) in discussing problems and working collaboratively to move forward.
• Obliging: This style of conflict management is usually adopted by people who
  have a non-confrontational nature and tend to settle conflicts by giving up their
  own needs and concerns to make peace. It is adopted by people who see their
  relationships as more important than their justifications. It can work to resolve
  minor issues, especially in marital relationships. When teachers value the interests
  of and their relationships with their students, they tend to adopt this conflict
  management style and follow students’ decisions rather than asserting their own
  needs.
• Compromising: This style of conflict management sees both parties willing to
  give up something to reach a common goal. It indicates a degree of concern for
  both the self and others. It is a practical strategy when time is a factor, as it enables
  temporary solutions, and is workable in low-level conflicts. Teachers using this
  strategy usually discuss the matter of concern with the whole class to explore a
  generally accepted way to settle the conflict or problem.
• Dominating: This style of conflict management is self-interest oriented. It is seen
  when someone with positional power or authority is dealing with someone who
  is less powerful. It leads to win-lose situations in which one party has to submit to
  the domination of the controlling party, resulting in increased relational problems.
  When teachers adopt such a strategy, they neglect and suppress the needs of their
  students, and this can lead to long-term problems.
• Avoiding: This style of conflict management indicates a low level of concern for
  both parties. It reflects a refusal to acknowledge the existence of a problem, or
  indifference to a problem-causing conflict. Avoidance may give immediate relief
  from anxiety or grievances, but it can also lead to further and more intense tension
  and conflict in the future. Teachers who are experiencing burnout or emotional
16.2 Teacher Efficacy in Facilitating SEL in School Education                     385

   stress may choose avoidance to deal with classroom conflicts, and need support
   from their schools to develop and strengthen their conflict management skills.
Studies have shown that teachers with high EI competence are better able to resolve
disagreements and resolve conflicts, and have a high preference for using integrating
and compromising strategies to instigate collaborative and cooperative problem-
solving and manage conflict (Chan, 2006; Godse & Thingujam, 2010; Henderson,
2006; Heris & Heris, 2011).
   Conflicts are not always negative. They can lead to improved thinking and help
us to develop wider perspectives by understanding others and adopting positive atti-
tudes to support them. Teachers need the support of their schools and other school
leaders to help them deal with conflicts. Schools can give this support by providing
needed learning and development opportunities. They can also benefit from recog-
nising potentially harmful influences that can impact student and staff wellbeing, and
establish support structures to guard against harmful personal attacks or aggressive
conflicts. By understanding common responses to conflict in the school community,
school leaders can plan to meet the development needs of their staff and members of
the school community in dealing with them.



16.3 What Should Schools Focus on to Increase Students’
     EI?

Schools play a central role in nurturing the healthy social and emotional development
of their students. Like cognitive skills, social-emotional competence can be learned
through different modes of education and specific learning activities, and in response
to the complex needs of and demands on modern students and teachers, schools
and education systems across the world are incorporating SEL into their national
curriculum frameworks and supporting the professional development of teachers
and school leaders to enable them to implement effective SEL.
   In 1994, a group of compassionate educators and scholars met in the U.S. and
formed an organisation known as CASEL—Collaborative for Academic, Social and
Emotional Learning. This organisation aims to promote high-quality, evidence-based
SEL as an integral part of school education from kindergarten through to high school.
Based on their years of research and practical experience, CASEL introduced an SEL
model which is now used worldwide. It identifies five core competencies that support
the healthy development of students throughout their early childhood to adolescence.
These are: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills
and responsible decision-making.
   Self-awareness is the ability to accurately recognise one’s own emotions and
   thoughts, and how they influence behaviour, and the ability to know one’s strengths
   and limitations.
386                                                    16 Helping Students to Develop …

     Self-management is the ability to regulate one’s emotions, thoughts and
     behaviour in different situations, including controlling impulses, managing stress,
     motivating oneself, setting goals and knowing how to work towards them.
     Social awareness is the ability to see the perspective of others, show empathy,
     understand social and ethical norms for behaviour, show respect for people from
     diverse backgrounds, and recognise family, school and community members as
     resources and support.
     Relationship skills is the ability to establish and maintain healthy friendships
     and relationships with diverse individuals and groups, and includes the ability to
     communicate clearly, listen actively, cooperate with others, resist inappropriate
     social pressure, handle conflict constructively and to know how to seek or offer
     help when required.
     Responsible decision-making is the ability to make constructive, safe and
     respectful choices about personal behaviour, realistically evaluate the possible
     consequences of various actions and look after one’s own wellbeing and that of
     others.
CASEL has also produced a framework to help educational systems develop a system
to plan and implement SEL in school settings. They stress that for authentic SEL to
take place and be transferred into practice, the whole school community, including
the government, needs to play a part, as establishing a pro-SEL school culture with
operable school policies and practices, and skilled teachers to create learning envi-
ronments that enhance SEL, requires authentic partnership from all stakeholders in
the school community.
   CASEL suggests four implementation focus areas. They are:
1.    Building foundational support and plans: At the state level, education
      ministries can create state-wide school policies, develop organisational struc-
      tures and fund the human resources needed to support school SEL. At the
      district level, systems leaders can plan and engage community stakeholders
      to support SEL learning goals and align human resources and financial supports
      to support school SEL. At the school level, school leaders can work collabora-
      tively to develop a shared vision and a clear plan with goals, action processes
      and ownership of implementation, and foster awards for practitioners.
2.    Strengthening adult SEL competencies and capacity: It is vital that univer-
      sities and advanced education institutions align their teacher and leadership
      education programs to equip teachers and school community members with the
      knowledge, skills and capabilities to implement SEL. State governments can
      also contribute by addressing social and cultural equity issues. District educa-
      tion and school leaders must also have the capability to cultivate a community
      of adults who engage in their own social and emotional learning and develop
      collaborative skills to promote SEL and serve as positive role models for their
      students.
3.    Promoting SEL for students: Education ministries need to provide frame-
      works for competence and measurement standards to support the high-quality
      implementation of evidence-based SEL programs and practices. They can also
16.3 What Should Schools Focus …                                                   387

     plan complementary programs to support parents and other community stake-
     holders. School leaders need to develop strategies to enhance students’ SEL
     across schools, classrooms, homes and communities.
4.   Reflecting on data for continuous improvement: District and state education
     leaders and policy-makers can set up mechanisms to collect data, monitor imple-
     mentation outcomes and use the results to provide additional support where
     needed to enhance SEL in schools that need extra support. At the school level,
     school leaders also need to establish structures to collect and apply data so that
     they can check program outcomes and plan for improvement.
Currently, many education systems and schools in the USA, Canada, Australia, and
Singapore follow the CASEL model, and have established system-wide and school-
wide organisational structures, policies and leadership preparations to support the
systemic implementation of SEL. Approaches in implementation include:
• integrating SEL skills into the academic curriculum in subjects such as Language
  Arts, social studies, science and maths, including incorporating SEL practice in
  classroom interactions through group and collaborative learning, with guidelines
  to support students in communicating with their classmates;
• knowing how to solve problems in the learning process; and
• designing free-standing lessons that address SEL competencies to help students
  develop emotional literacy, and specific skills and competency lessons to develop
  problem-solving, decision-making and conflict management skills (Hawkins
  et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2016; Rimm-Kaufman & Hulleman, 2015).
However, there are calls for more research into further understanding and addressing
the needs of indigenous students and students with additional support needs, students
who are new migrants, students who are at risk and students who are gifted in these
countries (Martin et al., 2017; Smith, 2017).
   In Asia, character education has always been a central part of the school
curriculum. Current practice also incorporates components of the CASEL model
to complement students’ classroom learning (Lee & Bong, 2017; Liem et al., 2017).
Though not a lot of research has been done on how Asian countries fare in promoting
SEL in their schools, from personal observation the author can attest that many
school leaders and teachers are very innovative in their integration of SEL into
their curriculum and extracurricular activities. Many young teachers and authors of
education-tech programs are likewise innovative and creative in producing software
and digital learning games to meet the needs and interests of Asian students that are
also culturally relevant.
   There are still many schools in both Western and Eastern countries that are not
supporting their teachers and students in developing SEL. Researchers interested
in understanding what teachers need in order to implement SEL effectively in the
curriculum have stressed the importance of supporting their development in creating
a positive and supportive classroom and having the essential competence to address
their own emotional challenges (Collie, 2017; Hazel, 2017).
388                                                  16 Helping Students to Develop …

    Guyn Cooper Research Associates (2013) have listed the barriers to doing this as:
•   lack of awareness of SEL as an approach.
•   fragmentation of practice.
•   lack of SEL’s alignment with education ministry outcomes.
•   competing views about evidence-based programs.
•   lack of pre-service or professional development in SEL for teachers.
This book aims to heighten awareness of the importance of SEL among school
policy-makers and education leaders so that they will do more to promote SEL in
their schools.



16.4 Current EI Programs Used in Schools Worldwide

In addition to school-based learning programs created by talented teachers and educa-
tional authors, there are some commercially-produced SEL programs that are used
worldwide. This section presents a few of the more common ones.

The ELSA Program
The Emotional Literacy Support Assistants (ELSA) program was introduced by a
British senior educational psychologist named Sheila Burton (2008). The program
aims to support the emotional education and development of young children and
teens by supporting teachers and teacher assistants to design learning resources for
individualised support programs that are tailored to the needs of individual students
with additional support needs. It provides training and support to help schoolchildren
develop social skills, anger management capabilities, friendship skills and ability
to deal with bereavement through the use of social stories, therapeutic stories and
activities, and counselling/coaching sessions. The length of the program depends on
the needs and progress of each student. It is now widely used in the UK and many
other parts of the world.

The RULER Approach
This is a systemic approach offered by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence of
Yale University, USA. RULER is an acronym for:
•   Recognising emotions in oneself and others.
•   Understanding the causes and consequences of emotions.
•   Labelling emotions with a nuanced vocabulary.
•   Expressing emotions in accordance with cultural norms and social contexts.
•   Regulating emotions with helpful strategies.
This is a comprehensive approach that involves the whole school community, as it
is based in the idea that EI is the ‘immune system’ for a healthy school. Learning
and development programs are designed to build the capabilities of school leaders at
all levels, including classroom teachers, school-based mental health professionals,
16.4 Current EI Programs Used in Schools Worldwide                                 389

parents and other members of the school community. It also provides a range of
resources to support school and community learning.
   The RULER approach holds that to enrich the EI of school children, the
whole school community must raise its EI. Intervention strategies therefore include
educating and providing skills training for school leaders, teachers and staff,
including teaching and learning elements in the school curriculum, and including
parent education to support optimal parenting. The program aims to enhance the
emotional literacy skills of both adults and children in the school community,
and to create a healthy emotional climate through the school in order to create
improved academic performances and outcomes, more harmonious and supportive
relationships, and a resilient and healthy school community.
   The RULER approach incorporates four ‘Anchor Tools for Emotional Intelli-
gence’, which were designed using evidence-based research and aim to enrich and
develop the EI of children and adults. They are: the Charter, the Mood Meter, the
Meta-Moment and the Blueprint.
   The Charter is a collaborative document established by members of the school
   community. Through discussion and exploration of their aspirations for a healthy
   school climate, school leaders, teachers and other members of the school commu-
   nity design and establish a supportive and productive school environment. This
   shared vision is then translated into an actionable and measurable document that
   outlines how they want to feel at school, the behaviours they want to see and
   the negativity they want to eliminate. Based on this shared vision, a charter is
   established to set common goals and accountability for achieving them.
   The Mood Meter is a learning system that helps students from kindergarten
   level to adolescence identify and label their emotions. It helps children to replace
   ‘meaningless’ phrases like ‘I’m OK’ or ‘I’m upset’ to articulate how they really
   feel, e.g., by saying ‘I feel alienated’ or ‘I feel helpless because I can’t figure
   this out’. By understanding the different layers of moods and emotions, and the
   proper labelling of these feelings, students learn to understand their emotions and
   become more self-aware of how these emotions affect them. When they can better
   express their emotional challenges with clarity and specific word choices, they can
   also seek help from adults without them second-guessing what the students need.
   The Mood Meter therefore empowers both teachers and students to recognise the
   full scope of their emotions and learn how to address them effectively.
   The Meta-Moment is a strategy that helps both adults and students to handle
   strong emotions by taking a step back and thinking, ‘What went wrong? How
   can I do better? What actions can I take to reflect my “best self”?’ It helps indi-
   viduals replace ineffective responses with more productive ones when faced with
   challenges. By helping students with this practice, teachers learn to do the same,
   enabling them to make better choices, build helpful relationships and experience
   enhanced wellbeing.
   The Blueprint helps educators, parents and students manage conflict more effec-
   tively. Using the Blueprint resources, both adults and students learn how to
   consider a disagreement from the other person’s perspective as well as from their

   own. They then work collaboratively to find a solution that will ease or end the
   conflict. This strategy helps learners to develop empathy and empowers them to
   repair relationships in an emotionally intelligent way. It also helps to restore the
   class climate after a conflict, and create a more optimistic learning environment.
RULER is currently one of the most popular approaches to teaching SEL in schools
worldwide. It has been translated into Spanish, Chinese and other languages.
    Brackett et al. (2012) conducted a study on the effectiveness of RULER in schools
and found that it is useful in helping teachers and educational professionals to develop
and strengthen their EI and EI competencies, and enables them to better handle stress.
Researchers who have studied the effectiveness of RULER have found a 10% increase
in students’ academic performance and a 12% improvement in classroom climate,
all after just one year of implementing RULER. They also found shifts in school
climate in some schools that have resulted in more positive youth development.
Specific student outcomes included: increased development of EI skills; stronger
social and leadership skills; increased confidence in solving relational problems; and
higher academic engagement leading to improved academic achievement. Among
adults, school leaders and teachers showed more positive relationships, experienced
lower levels of stress and burnout, became healthier both physically and mentally, and
enhanced their instructional practices (Bavarian et al., 2013; Brackett et al., 2012).



16.4.1 Digital Games for SEL

Digital games that teach SEL are gaining popularity among schoolchildren. Research
has substantiated the value of digital games in teaching SEL, arguing that these games
can increase students’ motivation, enable their knowledge assimilation, encourage
analysis and thinking, and provide rich simulations of reality which expose students
to different social rules and norms and help them develop intrapersonal and interper-
sonal emotional literacies. They allow students to ‘walk in someone’s else’s shoes’
and experience challenges and difficulties that they may not encounter in real life.
They also help students develop empathy and problem-solving skills and practice
making moral judgements (Garris et al., 2002; Hromek & Roffee, 2009; Prensky,
2007). Below are a few examples of the more popular digital games used in schools.
   The Second Step Elementary Digital Program
   The Second Step Elementary Digital Program (2021) is a large-scale program
   that provides schools with a well-planned SEL program that includes teachers’
   guides and lesson plans. There are five units in each theme, with each comprising
   a 15–30 minute teacher-student interaction followed by digital game activities.
   For example, in the ‘Emotional Management’ unit, students learn to explore and
   identify their own and other’s emotions, expand their emotional vocabulary and
   learn to understand different perspectives and respond to different situations. In the
   ‘Empathy and Kindness’ unit, students learn through digital games to recognise
16.4 Current EI Programs Used in Schools Worldwide                                  391

   kindness and act kindly towards others, and to understand what empathy means
   and how to apply it in their lives.
   Peekapak
   This is a literacy-based program that uses narrative in children’s stories to help
   young children to build foundational SEL skills such as empathy, self-regulation
   and emotional management. By helping digital animal characters overcome chal-
   lenges, children develop empathy and compassion for others, and learn how to
   problem-solve, make choices and overcome hardship independently.
   Happy 8–12 video game
   This game presents students aged 8–12 with different playground and classroom
   scenarios in which they must learn to think, evaluate the situation and choose what
   action to take. It aims to build skills in attention deployment, cognitive evaluation
   and decision-making. Faiella and Ricciardi (2015) conducted an evaluation of
   its effectiveness for 574 students. Based on the results of a pre-test and post-test
   questionnaire, they noted a marked improvement in the students’ understanding of
   emotional management skills. A reduction in playground conflict was also noted
   as a result of this program intervention.
   Spock video game
   This program, targeted at high school students, comprises four elements of EI—
   perception of emotions, emotions to facilitate thoughts, understanding emotions
   and emotional regulation. Spock is a fictional character in the Star Trek TV and
   movie TV series. As the Commanding Officer, he has to make hard decisions to
   ensure the safety of his crew. The video game presents students with hypothetical
   situations to help them understand both intrapersonal and interpersonal qualities.
   Students need to choose alternatives offered by the program and think about their
   decisions and consequences. Cejudo et al, (2019) conducted an investigation to
   find out how this program benefited young people aged 17–19. The results showed
   that the Spock video had a positive effective on the 92 adolescent participants’
   choices of behaviour. It improved the trait EI and psychosocial adjustments of
   the participants, especially boys. The researchers concluded that the game was an
   effective educational tool for schools to use in their SEL programs.
A recent report by Liverpool et al. (2020) has explored different digital interventions
used by mental health professionals and agencies to help young people face mental
health challenges and develop skills to resolve issues causing them stress and anxiety.
The key focus of this study was on how current interventions using digital learning and
activities are carried out, the level of engagement they can generate, and how effective
they are. They found that many of these web-based digital treatment programs are
comparable to face-to-face psychotherapy in effectively treating and reducing mental
health issues such as anxiety, depression and substance abuse among adolescents.
   Most digital intervention programs are presented in different modes and offer the
following learning components and practical strategies to help young people change
their mindsets and thinking patterns and improve their behaviour:
• cognitive behavioural therapy.
• cognitive skills training mechanisms.
392                                                    16 Helping Students to Develop …

• applied behaviour analysis concepts.
• social skills training.
• social support.
Most of these programs also included elements of information dissemination, peer-
to-peer communication, skills development, text message reminders, and multi-
media learning materials such as text, photos, audio and videos that can be easily
downloaded. Delivery modes include:
•   website interventions.
•   games and computer-assisted learning activities.
•   virtual reality experiences.
•   special learning apps for mobile devices.
•   robots and digital devices.
The young people involved in the study told the researchers that they were more likely
to use the intervention if it was facilitated by real people such as a psychologist or
therapist, and includes peers with whom they could share similar experiences through
text messages. Trust was a major concern for many of these young people, and so
they preferred to engage with programs presented by professionals that they knew, or
by well-known organisations. Many preferred not to have to disclose their personal
details, as they found it easier to tell strangers about their problems without being
known, to avoid embarrassment and discomfort.
   Liverpool et al. (2020) contend that digital intervention is a sound strategy for
helping young people to conquer their mental health challenges because it gives them
a sense of agency and control. However, structures must be put in place to ensure
that these programs cater to the needs of the users by providing needed support in a
progressive way. This will motivate the students to continue so that they will not give
up half-way through the intervention processes, and their effort will not be wasted.
Teachers and parents should be made aware of such programs, and enlist the advice
of school psychologists and social workers to help young people access such digital
interventions.
   In the last decade, increased focus has been placed on embedding EI into the
school curriculum. Studies have found numerous benefits from schools that take
a school-wide approach to doing this. The benefits have included greater student
engagement in academic work, a higher tolerance for stress both in students and
teachers, increased EI, self-confidence and self-efficacy in both teachers and students,
and student development of a range of social and interpersonal skills (Castillo et al.,
2013; Chang, 2013; Durlak et al., 2011; Nathanson et al., 2016; Reyes et al., 2012;
Yin et al., 2013).
   Education forms the foundation of any society. Schools play an important role in
shaping a nation’s future by nurturing and facilitating the all-round development of
their students. EI can steer us towards a path to a happy and fulfilled life. And as our
world gets more complex and demanding, we need these skills and competencies
more than ever before.
16.5 Practical Teaching Strategies                                                   393

16.5 Practical Teaching Strategies

Teachers around the world are beginning to realise the importance of EI in education.
For years, many teachers have been using different class-based and teacher-designed
activities to help children to develop moral understanding, friendliness, cooperation
and other essential character strengths, but in addition to a systemic approach such
as the RULER approach discussed in Sect. 16.4, there are other strategies that can
also be helpful in developing students’ emotional intelligence (intrapersonal) and
social-emotional intelligence (interpersonal and social).
   Some of the core skills (Brackett et al., 2012; Durlak et al., 2015;) required to
strengthen students’ EI or SEI include:
   Reflective thinking: This enables us to understand why we do what we do and how
   doing it affects us (positively or negatively). It involves exploring our emotions and
   reactions, and our knowledge of what drives our reactions and behaviours. Reflec-
   tive thinking helps us to identify causes and effects, actions and consequences. In
   learning, reflective thinking is a higher-order form of thinking. Through reflective
   learning, we can relate new knowledge to prior understandings, move from the
   concrete to the abstract, and understand how to apply new knowledge to help us
   in our thinking, study and work performance.
   Metacognition: This is the ability to understand and examine how we process
   our thoughts and feelings. Having metacognition skills helps us to identify our
   own learning needs and styles and to understand how we gather and organise
   information in our heads, plan to do a task, view and evaluate success, monitor
   mistakes and develop strategies to adjust, change and improve. Metacognition
   skills can increase our self-awareness.
   Empathy: This is the ability to appreciate how the world looks from other people’s
   perspective, and to understand and share their feelings. It includes the ability
   to share our feelings with others in appropriate ways, show interest in others,
   acknowledge their feelings and offer support, and be encouraging and comforting
   when they are suffering. It also includes the ability to show gratitude to others
   who are kind and supportive. To increase our empathy, we need to be imaginative,
   accepting and open-minded.
   Creativity: This is the ability to generate new ideas and recognise alternatives and
   new ways to solve a problem or create something new. It involves drawing knowl-
   edge and ideas from our memories and looking at them from different angles to
   find new understandings or inspirations. It also involves communicating well with
   others to gain different perspectives so that we can increase our knowledge and
   learn new thinking patterns. Creativity opens our minds and helps us to overcome
   our prejudices and biases. It can help us to deal with uncertainty and cope with
   the unknown.
   A few years ago, I heard a very sad joke. It begins:
   Early one morning a mother went to her sleeping son and woke him up.
394                                                       16 Helping Students to Develop …

   Mother:   “Wake up, son. It’s time to go to school.”
   Son:      “But why, Mama? I don’t want to go to school.”
   Mother:   “Give me two reasons why you don’t want to go to school.”
   Son:      “The children hate me and all the teachers hate me.”
   Mother:   “But you must go to school. You are the school principal!”

As a special needs teacher, I had the privilege of visiting many different schools
in Sydney, Australia. Most of these schools, especially primary schools, were
welcoming and had a happy atmosphere. The children loved school and did not
wish to miss a school day even when they were sick.
   Skillful teachers know how to create a fun-filled, stress-free, cooperative learning
environment. They set clear rules and behavioural expectations at the beginning of
the school term which are visible in the classrooms. Smart teachers are creative
and have novel ideas to make these rules look appealing instead of threatening; they
empower their students to set their own class rules and ask them to present these rules
on posters to give them ownership. Students are rewarded for good behaviour rather
than being punished for unacceptable behaviour. Children with behaviour challenges
are dealt with privately after class to protect their self-esteem. And children who need
extra behaviour support are given one-on-one attention, so that they will respond in
a positive manner and make an effort to do the right thing in class.
   Teachers who show zest for their work and a friendly demeanour are admired
by their students. Their enthusiasm is contagious, and their cheerfulness inspires
children to learn. Of course, no one is happy all the time, but when teachers are
aware of their emotional state, they are able to promote an active learning envi-
ronment by empowering their students to lead learning activities too. Emotionally
intelligent teachers are also resourceful. They know how to enlist help from other
school community members. They may invite parents and other professionals to help
with classroom learning, such as leading literacy or numeracy groups, art and music
activities or outdoor learning that increases the general knowledge of the community
and the development of responsible citizens.
   Some of the more common strategies that can help to develop and boost students’
EI include:
   Conversation circles: Many teachers use this strategy to help students discuss
   emotional matters, relationships and friendships, and current affairs in order to
   stimulate thinking, enable students to see different perspectives, improve attention
   and listening skills, become open-minded and non-judgmental, and contribute
   ideas to solve problems. It is also a very helpful way for students with non-English
   speaking backgrounds to improve their language skills. However, teachers have
   to be skillful in setting rules and forming groups to enhance cooperation and meet
   the diverse needs of different student groups.
   Class meetings: These can be run by student leaders in the class, and can
   teach them skills including preparing an agenda to define a meeting’s goals and
   purposes. Class meetings can enhance an environment of trust and respect and
   promote a stronger sense of belonging. To create an emotionally intelligent class,
16.5 Practical Teaching Strategies                                                  395

   however, teachers need to make sure that students are inclusive and that no one
   is made to feel left out or not valued. Holding well-run class meetings can lay
   a strong foundation for student collaboration and strengthen students’ sense of
   democracy and consensus.
   Storytelling: This is not only an effective way to increase students’ receptive
   and expressive language skills, but also a way to help them understand emotions
   through the characters of the story and the circumstances they are in. It gives
   them the opportunity to see from another person’s experience, whether fictional
   or real, and that can shape, strengthen or challenge their opinions and values.
   Through listening to each other’s stories, students also build trust and create
   deeper connections with their classmates. It is an effective way to unite emotions
   with intention and meaning.
   Journal writing: This is a powerful tool to help individuals reflect on their feel-
   ings and understand their emotional responses to situations. Putting thoughts into
   words is a good way to gain clarity about a problem or an anticipation. Journal
   writing is also a private way to vent one’s unexpressed emotions, which is good
   for mental health. Reading over what we have written afterwards can also give us
   insights into how we respond to challenges and difficulties when we are emotional,
   and how our thoughts can change over time. Encouraging students to write journals
   will increase their writing and language skills.
   Literature and poetry: Novels, short stories and poetry are filled with emotions.
   Literature offers a gateway to SEL in the classroom. Through reading about the
   ecstatic joy, hair-raising horror, tormenting pain, distressing anguish, and heart-
   wrenching struggles of the characters in a story, students can gain insight into
   human behaviours that they may never experience in their own lives. They can
   learn to compare the characteristics and personality traits of different characters,
   think about the actions and reactions of the characters and reflect on how they
   might behave if they were placed in such circumstances. Some poetry and writing
   presents vivid descriptions of body language to convey deep feelings, and this can
   also help students learn about how emotion is conveyed.
   EI through art: Art and craft can be a wonderful therapeutic experience for
   students, especially for younger children who do not yet have enough language
   skills to express themselves. Consciously or unconsciously, people use different
   colours to express emotions. However, teachers must be mindful not to focus
   on the ‘beauty’ of an artwork, but instead look at how and why the art piece is
   presented in the way the student has chosen. Every piece of art has meaning to
   the artist, and it is the teacher’s job to explore it and understand what it means to
   the child. Craft work such as kneading dough can also be an outlet for anger or
   excessive energy.
   EI through music: Music evokes all kinds of emotions. Upbeat music can lift
   our mood and make us want to dance. Certain songs or melodies embedded in our
   memories can evoke pleasant or painful experiences from the past. The power of
   music has been studied for decades; in the 1990s, schools across the world were
   influenced by the ‘Mozart effect’ and played soft music in the background during
   lessons to enhance learning. Music as therapy has also helped patients who suffer
396                                                  16 Helping Students to Develop …

  from anxiety to calm down and relax. Rap music is a way for new generations
  of young people to share their resentments and voice their anger. Music can also
  aid learning by putting rhymes to melodies help children to memorise poetry,
  timelines in history, maths formulas or even the periodic table of elements. And
  when students learn to play music as a group, they learn to listen to each other,
  wait their turn, play in harmony and understand the importance of unison.
  EI through dancing and movement: Many schools and educators have realised
  the social and emotional benefits dance offers. While many students enjoy hip-
  hop dancing and other free-form creative dancing styles, ballroom dancing is
  also making its way into school learning. Researchers suggest that it can promote
  teamwork, respect for others and social etiquette. Cooper (2010) claims that when
  teachers and parents combine books and stories with music and movement, it
  increases cognitive and language skills and language acquisition because chil-
  dren can express their thoughts and feelings through movement. The literature also
  illustrates that dancing can boost social-emotional skills, promote creative expres-
  sion and enhance not only verbal but also non-verbal communication between
  dance partners. It also promotes self-regulation in the form of ignoring distractions
  and resisting impulses in order to follow the rhythm of the music. It builds self-
  confidence in children, especially when they are encouraged to perform in front
  of an audience, and is a good way to showcase the strengths of some students who
  do not often receive recognition through academic achievement. Dance education
  can also help students appreciate other cultures, arts and celebrations.
  Social media and TV: Social media has become a very intimate part of our lives,
  especially for young people. While there are many positive aspects of using social
  media for communication and connecting with friends, there are also numerous
  negative ones. Researchers have shown that prolonged use of social media plat-
  forms such as Facebook and Instagram is related to symptoms of depression,
  anxiety and stress, and can affect young people’s self-image and self-identity
  development, giving them distorted views of what is ‘cool’ and what is ‘appalling’
  (Barryman et al., 2018; O’Reilly, 2020; O’Reilly et al., 2018).
  Likewise, many reality shows on television can have a bad influence on young
  people. Perritano (2021) comments that ‘reality television is the lowest form of
  entertainment, an insult to our collective intelligence. Many of these shows glorify
  abuse, elevate shallow personalities and promote dysfunctional relationships’.
  Even cookery shows, from which viewers can learn useful cooking techniques and
  scrumptious recipes, have a competition format that ruins the viewers’ enjoyment
  by encouraging negative behaviour and spiteful comments from the competitors
  to ‘spice up the content’. Likewise, instead of promoting cooperation, shows
  about building and renovating houses focus on contestants using scornful and
  contemptuous language to discuss each other and promote negative behaviour
  based in jealousy and feelings of insecurity. Additionally, romance-focused shows
  promote promiscuity and discriminatory judgement of others who fail to meet the
  superficial ideals of the show’s protagonist (Cassidy, 2006; Taylor, 2011). Children
  and young people therefore need guidance from teachers and parents to help them
  understand what ‘reality’ actually is and how they can be a wise viewer.
16.5 Practical Teaching Strategies                                                 397

Teachers are creative and versatile. When they work together with their colleagues
and other members of the school community, they can come up with omnifarious
ideas for implementing SEL at schools. Asking for input from students will also
spark innovative initiatives grounded in these young people’s perspectives, needs
and interests.



16.6 Conclusion

Our children are our future. Their personal qualities and characters will determine
the choices and decisions they make to shape the society they live in. As parents,
teachers and educators, it is our obligation and responsibility to nurture them as best
we possibly can. We need to tap into their personal talents and interests in order to
develop their potential so that they can lead happy, fulfilling lives and ideally, be
contributing global citizens.
    As we progress into an advanced and fast-changing era, schools and education
leaders have come to realise the importance of a whole-child development approach
to education. This comprehensive approach supports and nurtures students’ develop-
ment and learning, from cognitive skills including literacy, numeracy, science under-
standing and technology innovations to a focus on developing their social-emotional
growth and mental health. This has become an integral part of education.
    Good mental health is also vital to our overall wellbeing. By helping children
develop emotional intelligence from early childhood, we can prepare them to make
good life choices throughout each stage of development. To do this, parents, teachers
and school leaders must develop a broader and deeper knowledge of the different
development demands and needs children have as they transition from one life-stage
to another. They must understand how family relationships impact a child’s emotional
growth, how sibling relationships can support or hamper their socio-psychological
growth at different stages of their lives, how they make friends and develop interper-
sonal skills, and what challenges they may experience leading emotional stress. As
adults, we need to have sufficient EI competence ourselves to facilitate the EI growth
of our children.
    As parents and professionals, we also are faced with different challenges in our
own work lives. Some of us may experience work-life balance issues, which in turn
will hamper our marital and family relationships if we do not handle them properly.
When we have the opportunity to develop our EI and lift our EI competence, we will
know how to seek support to overcome these challenges, so that we can be healthy
and positive role models for our children.
    Mental health issues are complex. We need a holistic approach to address these
problems. When we have the skills and understanding to work collaboratively as a
school community, we can harness this energy and positivity to achieve more. We can
support those who struggle in poverty and help parents overcome their challenges
by establishing supportive networks. We can also form a collective voice to urge
398                                                            16 Helping Students to Develop …

governments and politicians to do more to ease current social problems. We can
volunteer to help others, even if it is just one person at a time. Be more! Do more!
